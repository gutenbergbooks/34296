<p class='c'>To<br />
<span class='fs12'>Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Tewksbury</span><br />
whose life in the Wyoming Mountains has<br />
made Ross Grant, Tenderfoot, possible, I<br />
cordially dedicate this book</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<p class='c fs12'>Introduction</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span><span class='sc'>When</span> I went over the same route, some time
before Ross Grant traveled it, from Cody eighty
miles into the snow-capped Shoshones, I found
how welcome a "Doc Tenderfoot" would be in the
gold mining camp at the end of the route. There
was, in camp, the superintendent of one of the
mining companies, a man who had never had any
instruction in things medical or surgical, but who,
with a steady hand and a cool head, and an acquired
knowledge of "first aids," was often called
on in case of sickness and accident, as there was
no doctor nearer than Cody. Such a state of affairs
greeted Ross Grant when he arrived with his
medical "emergency chest" and his real knowledge
of the use to which its contents should be
put.</p>

<p>Also, I found a certain "outfit" of men, not
McKenzie in name but in nature, waiting to
"jump" certain valuable "claims" provided the
owners failed in any particular to measure up to
the requirements of the law. Their intention was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
to do the "jumping" legally and not through
"gun play," which is becoming an obsolete custom
in that great state.</p>

<p>Then, too, I discovered over on a real Meadow
Creek Valley&#8211;exactly the same place that Ross
found&#8211;a real "Dutch Weimer" afflicted with
snow-blindness, imprisoned for months at a time
in the little valley because of the danger from
snowslides on the mountainsides.</p>

<p>And, by the way, if you should ever follow this
same interesting trail from Cody up into the
mountains, you would find "Ross Grant, Tenderfoot"
an accurate guide-book until you reached the
end of the stage route. There you would find that
Miners&#8217; Camp is a fictitious name applied to a real
place. And if you should chance to be in camp on
the Fourth of July, you would realize fully the
difficulties that Ross had to contend against in the
vast snowfalls. For the year I visited the mountains
the glorious Fourth was celebrated by snow-shoe
races down the mountainsides! There are
snow-storms every month in the year there, but
Miners&#8217; Camp is comparatively free from snow
during August and September.</p>

<p>These are the months, then, when gold hunters,
"prospectors," are most numerous in the mountains.
I saw them everywhere with their "pack
outfits" bound on wooden saddles, seeking in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
rocks for indications of a fortune that is as elusive
in their business as the proverbial "pot of gold at
the end of a rainbow."</p>

<p>But, although Ross Grant did not immediately
find a fortune, he found what is far more desirable,
the development of muscle, quick wit and nerve
in the situations which he was obliged to face and
conquer in these adventure-breeding mountains.</p>

<p>"Ross Grant, Gold Hunter" tells of the hero&#8217;s
further adventures in the mountains and of his hard
won "find."</p>

<p>In "Ross Grant on the Trail" he meets many
discouragements, but finally conquers them.</p>

<h1>Ross Grant, Tenderfoot</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'><span class='sc'>A BORN SURGEON</span></span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Dr. Fred Grant</span>, recalled in haste from his daily
round of professional visits by a telephone message
from his nephew, leaped out of his carriage over
the yet moving wheel, and, stuffing an open letter
into his pocket, rushed up the walk and into his
office, which occupied a wing of his commodious
house.</p>

<p>A sight met his eyes which was not uncommon,
situated as he was in the midst of the coal fields of
Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. Stretched out
on the leather couch lay a man from the mines,
black and grimy, his right arm crushed. Two
other miners, also blackened with coal-dust, sat on
the edges of their chairs, their eyes following the
movements of Ross Grant, the doctor&#8217;s nephew and
self-constituted assistant.</p>

<p>Those movements had been rapid and effective.
Again and again had this seventeen-year-old boy
been brought face to face with such cases as this,
and he handled it promptly and wordlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
Words, indeed, would have been wasted, as none
of his callers spoke English. He had quieted the
sufferer with a hypodermic injection of morphine,
stripped the injured arm, cleansed it, and treated
it with a temporary dressing.</p>

<p>Then, with the bandages firmly in place, he had
gone to the telephone and patiently called up house
after house until he found his uncle.</p>

<p>When Dr. Grant entered the office, he found
Ross calmly taking the temperature of the wounded
man.</p>

<p>"He must have met with the accident at least
an hour before they got him here," the boy explained,
"for he was suffering awfully. I thought
I ought to fix him up before trying to find you."</p>

<p>His uncle nodded with satisfaction, and bent
over the man. "All right," he commended briefly,
but his tone said more. Words were not always
necessary to an understanding between uncle and
nephew.</p>

<p>The younger man was an abridged edition of the
older in form and feature. In movements the two
were alike only so long as Ross was aiding the
doctor on such an occasion as this. Then there
were in both the same alertness and quiet intentness,
the same compression of the lips and narrowing
of the eyes. But when the strain of the
hour was past and the miners gone, the boy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
manner changed. The alert quality which characterized
the uncle at all times seemed to desert the
nephew, and his movements became slow. From
the born surgeon in embryo he became a rather
awkward, self-conscious boy.</p>

<p>Throwing himself into a chair behind the table,
he drew toward him Gray&#8217;s "Anatomy," and began
reading at a line marked by a paper-cutter, his
closely cropped head grasped in both hands.</p>

<p>The older man moved around the room restlessly,
occasionally glancing with troubled eyes at
the figure behind the table. Standing finally in
front of the window, he drew the letter from his
pocket, smoothed it out, and read it again.</p>

<p>In front of him, in the valley, lay Pittston and
Wilkes-Barre, with Scranton in the distance, and
beyond, the sun-burned hills, almost hidden now
by the smoke from a hundred coal-breakers, and
by the late August haze.</p>

<p>"Ross," began Dr. Grant abruptly, without turning,
"I&#8217;m afraid you are going to meet disappointment&#8211;to
a certain extent. I have a letter
from your father."</p>

<p>The boy raised his head with a jerk. "Do you
mean that he forbids<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"No,"&#8211;the doctor turned slowly,&#8211;"not exactly.
He expects to send for you in a few days,
and will tell you himself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>Ross&#8217;s chin came up. "And I shall not be
twenty-one for nearly four years yet!" he exclaimed
aggressively.</p>

<p>His uncle looked at him with more sternness
than he felt. "Remember, Ross, that he is your
father and that you owe him<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross interrupted hotly, looking longingly at the
letter. "I don&#8217;t owe him as much as I do you
and Aunt Anne."</p>

<p>Dr. Grant made no reply, nor did he share the
letter. Putting it into an inner pocket, he left the
office, and presently Ross heard the sound of wheels
on the drive. Dr. Grant was starting again on his
interrupted round of calls.</p>

<p>The boy leaned back and drew a deep breath.
His father was going to send for him, and would
then tell him&#8211;what? That he could not enter a
medical college? That he could not become a
surgeon? That he must fit himself for a business
career? His chin came up again. He looked
around the office lingeringly. It had been the
heart of his home for seven years. It represented
to him all that he wished to become. His father
was almost a stranger to him; his uncle had stood
in the place of a father since he, a sickly boy of
ten, had been sent from the city to gain health
on the hills which girdle Wyoming Valley.</p>

<p>He had gained health. In so far he had fulfilled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
his father&#8217;s wishes. But, in addition, he had
gained a knowledge and been settled in a desire
extremely displeasing to Ross Grant, Senior, who
expected to train his only son to continue his own
business.</p>

<p>"Grant &amp; Grant" was the father&#8217;s ambition;
"Dr. Grant" the son&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Presently Dr. Grant&#8217;s wife appeared in the doorway
of the office. She was a short, round woman,
with a laughing face and a pretty, bustling air of
authority. Stopping abruptly, she shook a chubby
forefinger at Ross.</p>

<p>"All day to-day," she accused, "you have bent
over that book."</p>

<p>Ross, his elbows planted on the table and his
chin resting on his fists, shook his head. He did
not look up.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ve been studying Gray on Anatomy, Aunt
Anne. Got to master him."</p>

<p>Aunt Anne bobbed energetically across the
room, and slammed the volume shut. "There!"
she cried triumphantly. "Get out and walk five
miles, and strengthen your own anatomy!"</p>

<p>Under her light tones and in the affectionate
touch of her hand as she ran her fingers through
his hair, Ross detected an undercurrent of solicitude,
which brought forth a counter-accusation.
Rising hastily, he laid both hands on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
shoulders, and looked down from an altitude
of five feet ten.</p>

<p>"Aunt Anne, you know what father wrote to
uncle, don&#8217;t you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant&#8217;s eyes fell. "Better take a good
run over the mountain, Ross," she parried.</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s hands slipped from her shoulders. "I
see there&#8217;s no use asking either of you what he
wrote."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant flecked some dust from the table.
"Sometimes, Ross," was her only reply, "disappointment
is the very best and most strengthening
tonic we can take."</p>

<p>She turned away, adding without glancing back
as she left the room: "I do wish, Ross, that you&#8217;d
get out and exercise more. You would conquer
Gray&#8217;s &#8217;Anatomy&#8217;&#8211;and all other difficulties&#8211;more
quickly if you would."</p>

<p>"I guess you&#8217;re right, Aunt Anne," assented
Ross.</p>

<p>"Yes," scolded Aunt Anne to her sister in the
living-room&#8211;but the scolding rested on a very
apparent foundation of love&#8211;"Ross always agrees
with me about taking vigorous exercise&#8211;and then
never takes it. Now watch him walk, will you?"
she fretted, looking out of the window.</p>

<p>Her sister, busily sewing, paused with suspended
needle, and glanced out. Ross was going slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
down the drive, his head bent forward, his youthful
shoulders carelessly sagging, his long arms
aimlessly hanging, giving him a curiously helpless
appearance at variance with his large frame.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s Ross&#8217;s own fault," declared Aunt Anne.
"He doesn&#8217;t like to exert himself physically. Not
that he&#8217;s lazy," defensively, "for he isn&#8217;t. He
would work all night over a patient, and never
think of himself; but to get out and exercise for
the sake of exercising, and straightening himself
up, and holding himself, somehow&#8211;well, I&#8217;ve
talked myself hoarse about it, and then found that
he had been reading some medical book or other
all the time I was talking!"</p>

<p>Here Aunt Anne laughed silently, and ran her
shears through a length of gingham, adding, as if
the addition were a logical sequence to her monologue:</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s a mystery to me how his father can feel so
disappointed in him."</p>

<p>"Disappointed in Ross?" exclaimed the sister
in a tone of wonder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant nodded. "His father sends for him
once a year, sees him for a day or two when Ross
is at the greatest disadvantage in unaccustomed surroundings&#8211;you
know the stepmother is a woman
of fashion; and the result is that he is so awkward
and slow and tongue-tied that his father&#8211;well,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
Mrs. Grant bit off her thread energetically, "of
course, we feel tender on the subject because we
have had Ross now for seven years, and we think
a better boy never lived. But now the time has
come," her voice trembled, "when we must give
him up."</p>

<p>"Will his father forbid his going to medical
college?" asked the sister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant hesitated. "No, I don&#8217;t think he
will forbid it; but he will prevent it&#8211;if he is
able," she added significantly.</p>

<p>Two days later the summons from Ross Grant,
Senior, arrived in the shape of a telegram brief
and to the point. "Take night-train," it read,
"September first. Reach office at nine."</p>

<p>"Ross," worried Aunt Anne as she straightened
his tie and hovered around him anxiously the
afternoon of September first, "you&#8217;d better get a
new hat in Scranton. This one is&#8211;well, I think
you better appear before Mrs. Grant in a new one."</p>

<p>"All right, aunt."</p>

<p>Dr. Grant extended his hand, and gripped Ross&#8217;s.
"Remember, my boy, that the telegram appointed
nine <span class='sc'>a. m.</span> as the time for your appearing."</p>

<p>Ross laughed. "Don&#8217;t you worry, uncle," he
returned confidently. "I shall be at the office
before father gets there."</p>

<p>But, despite his confidence, it was nearly ten the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
morning following before he stepped out of the
elevator of a Broadway office building and presented
himself hesitatingly before the clerk in his
father&#8217;s outer office.</p>

<p>His hesitation was due to his appearance. His
hat, new the afternoon before, was soiled and
pierced by the calk of a horse&#8217;s shoe. His shirtfront
was also soiled and then smeared over by a
wet cloth in a vain effort to remove the dirt. His
right coat-sleeve was wrinkled, and bore marks of
a recent wetting. About his clothes lingered a
subtle "horsy" odor, which caused the clerk to
sniff involuntarily as he curiously looked over the
heir to the house of Grant before disappearing into
the inner office.</p>

<p>When he returned he bore the crisp message
that Ross was to wait until his father had time to
see him.</p>

<p>Ross waited. He retreated to a window through
which the sunshine streamed, and there sat, industriously
drying his wet sleeve. He pulled it,
and smoothed it, and stretched it, only to see it
shrivel and shrink while he waited. The clerk
occasionally glanced with no abating of curiosity
from the boy to the clock. Two hours passed.
Others waiting in that outer office grew restless.
They read. They took quick turns about the
room. They went out into the corridor, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
returned. At last, one by one, they were ushered
into the inner office, while Ross still waited.</p>

<p>It was past twelve before his father sent for him,
and the first glance the boy encountered was one
of displeasure.</p>

<p>"Did you come in on the night-train?" was
the elder Grant&#8217;s greeting.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The father frowned, and looked up at a clock
which ticked above their heads.</p>

<p>"I telegraphed you that I could see you at nine."</p>

<p>Ross sank into a great padded, leather-upholstered
chair. All about him were evidences of
luxury, but he was conscious only of his father&#8217;s
displeasure and of his own disreputable appearance.
He studied his hands awkwardly, and
stumbled in his reply.</p>

<p>"I should have been here by nine, sir, but for
an accident which occurred on the ferry<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Accident?" His father&#8217;s tone softened.</p>

<p>Ross looked at his coat-sleeve. "There was a
fine horse, a big bay that stood behind a truckster&#8217;s
cart. He took an apple. It lodged in his throat,
and he nearly choked to death." The boy hesitated
and glanced up. "I got it out," he explained
simply, adding apologetically, "I got awfully
mussed up doing it, though."</p>

<p>"You!" Grant burst out, paying no attention to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
the apology. "You got it out!" He leaned forward,
genuinely interested. "How did you do it?"</p>

<p>Ross warmed under the interest in the tone. "I
was standing in the bow of the boat, just over the
rail from the horse, and I saw what the trouble
was. There was no one else who seemed to know
what to do." He spoke modestly. "The horse
would have died before we reached the landing;
and so," simply, "I ran my arm down his throat,
and got the apple."</p>

<p>"You did!" ejaculated Grant. He leaned further
forward. "And what prevented the horse
from chewing up your arm while you were after
the apple?"</p>

<p>"A bootblack&#8217;s brush," Ross explained. "A
boy was rubbing up a man&#8217;s shoes near me; and I
grabbed his brushes, and got busy. One of the
deck hands helped me prop the horse&#8217;s mouth
open. I threw off my coat"&#8211;here Ross surveyed
himself ruefully, and left the subject of the
horse; "and I got pretty dirty all over. Couldn&#8217;t
help it. There wasn&#8217;t any time to think of keeping
clean. But after we got over on the New York
side the owner of the horse took me to a stable,
and helped me to clean up; but&#8211;I don&#8217;t think
it&#8217;s much of a success."</p>

<p>Mr. Grant leaned back in his swivel chair, rested
his elbows on the arms, and fitted his finger-tips
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
together. His imagination, country-trained in his
youth, was supplying some of the details which
his son had omitted. He nodded his iron-gray
head, and narrowed his eyes, a trick common to
all the Grants when intent on any subject.</p>

<p>"Quick work," he remarked after a pause. His
eyes were taking the measure of his son. "It had
to be quick work," he added as if to convince
himself that Ross could act swiftly.</p>

<p>"Where did you get breakfast?" was his next
question.</p>

<p>"I haven&#8217;t had any," Ross replied. "I tried to
get here by nine o&#8217;clock."</p>

<p>A low whistle escaped the father. He arose,
and reached for his hat, which lay on the top
of a safe behind him. "We&#8217;ll go out to lunch
now."</p>

<p>Ross glanced doubtfully from his father&#8217;s well-groomed
person to his own dirty coat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, father, you&#8217;d like me to go out alone
so long as<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" interrupted Grant brusquely.</p>

<p>As they left the room, he took his boy&#8217;s arm.
There was little resemblance between the two.
Ross had his uncle&#8217;s head with its high brow and
well-shaped chin, lean cheeks, and prominent ears.
He was taller than his father, but wholly lacked
his father&#8217;s energetic manner and erect carriage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>"You graduated in June from Wyoming Seminary,"
the father stated as they entered a large
Broadway restaurant and sat down near the door.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"No honors?"</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes fell. "No, sir. I stood tenth in
a class of thirty-four."</p>

<p>Evasion of the truth was not one of Ross&#8217;s
strong points.</p>

<p>"And," stated his father, "it took you five years
to do a four years&#8217; course."</p>

<p>Ross looked his father squarely in the eyes, and
lifted his chin a little. The father noticed for the
first time that the boy&#8217;s chin could indicate aggression.</p>

<p>"I flunked on mathematics. But I made them
up the next summer, and went on."</p>

<p>Again Grant looked at his son attentively, the
son who retrieved his failure and "went on."</p>

<p>"You&#8217;re seventeen," he said abruptly. "What&#8217;s
next?" The question, as both knew, was superfluous.</p>

<p>"Medical college," Ross answered as abruptly as
the question had been put. "I am preparing for
the entrance examinations in the University of
Pennsylvania. I want to go down and take them
in January, and at the same time pass upon a
couple of subjects in the freshman year."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>There was a gleam of curiosity in Grant&#8217;s deep-set
eyes as he put the next questions.</p>

<p>"Haven&#8217;t I told you repeatedly that I shall
never advance one penny on a medical education
for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Ross&#8217;s eyes met his father&#8217;s steadily
but respectfully. "And I shall not ask you
to advance a cent."</p>

<p>"But haven&#8217;t I forbidden your uncle, also, to
help you out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and Uncle Fred has no intention of
helping me. He&#8217;ll keep the letter and the spirit
of the law you have laid down."</p>

<p>"Well, then<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross smiled quietly. "But you have never forbidden
my getting a medical education through my
own efforts; and that, father, is what I intend to do."</p>

<p>Ross Grant, Senior, found himself looking into
eyes which he recognized as strangely like his
own and shining with the same determination
which in himself had established a thriving business
and built up a moderate fortune. Never had
he been so interested in his son. Never had he
so coveted him for a business career. But, as he
ate a moment in silence, young Ross&#8217;s determined
voice seemed to be repeating in old Ross&#8217;s ears,
"That, father, is what I intend to do."</p>

<p>During the remainder of the meal the elder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
Grant listened attentively to the younger&#8217;s plans.
To Ross this was a new experience. After the
first irritation over his tardiness, his father had
not once oppressed him with that sense of disapproval
and disappointment which usually sent
him back to his uncle with a buoyant relief at
his escape from New York.</p>

<p>Still, he was not deceived. He knew that his
father&#8217;s summons had to do with the thwarting of
his surgical career; and he was prepared to argue,
persuade, do anything short of actual defiance, to
gain permission to work for the object toward
which all his inclinations pulled.</p>

<p>As they made their way up Broadway through
the noon-hour crowd, a feminine voice behind
them suddenly piped out excitedly:</p>

<p>"There he is, Kate, right ahead of you&#8211;that
tall, round-shouldered young man. He&#8217;s the one
I told you about on the ferry this morning. I tell
you what, he made all the men around step lively
for a few minutes."</p>

<p>Ross suddenly quickened his pace. His face
flushed uncomfortably, but the voice of "Kate&#8217;s"
companion was still at his heels.</p>

<p>"Why, he grabbed them brushes and was over
the rail as quick as a cat, and had that horse&#8217;s
mouth open before its owner even knew that it
was chokin&#8217;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>Ross, Senior, strode along behind Ross, Junior,
now in a vain attempt to keep up. He chuckled
in a sly enjoyment of the boy&#8217;s embarrassment.</p>

<p>"He certainly can move, I see," he muttered,
"when he has something to move toward&#8211;or
away from!"</p>

<p>But the mutter was lost on Ross seeking an
escape from that voice of praise by dodging in and
out among the crowd until his father lost sight of
him, and found him again only at the entrance to
the office building.</p>

<p>When the two were again seated in the private
office, the father for the first time broached the
matter which he had called the son from Pennsylvania
to hear; and, had he studied the boy for
months, he could not have overcome his opposition
more tactfully and completely.</p>

<p>"Ross," he began quietly, "I am not going to
forbid your going to a medical college this year or
any other year. To be honest with you, I admire
your grit. I believe it will bring you success.
And so, as I say, I am not going to forbid your
entering the University of Pennsylvania. But&#8211;I
am going to ask a favor of you."</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s eyes sparkled. His father swung around,
and, picking up a pencil, marked aimlessly on a
pad lying on the big mahogany desk.</p>

<p>"Well, father."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>"I am going to ask you to help me pay a debt
which I owe&#8211;and the payment will certainly spoil
this year so far as college is concerned."</p>

<p>Grant paused. He did not look up, but he
heard Ross draw a deep breath. Then there was
silence.</p>

<p>"Keep in mind," Grant began again, "that I am
not requiring this of you&#8211;I am asking it."</p>

<p>"Yes&#8211;sir."</p>

<p>The tone gave the father the uncomfortable impression
that he was assisting at a surgical operation
on his son, but he bent his head a little lower
over the pad, and traced figures more carefully as he
began abruptly on a seemingly new subject.</p>

<p>"Have I ever told you about my Western
partner, Jake Weimer?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I started business in the West without a
cent, and it was Weimer who gave me my start.
He was running a store in Butte, and took me
with him. I have managed to get beyond a start,
but Weimer never has. After I came East he lost
his share of our earnings, and turned prospector.
Ever since he has spent his life trying to squeeze
gold out of the mountains. Again and again he
has staked out claims, and I&#8217;ve grub-staked him
to the finish. For twenty-five years this has gone
on. So far, none of the properties have amounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
to much; still, we hold them; there&#8217;s always a
chance of a rise in value."</p>

<p>Grant drew straight, heavy lines on the pad as
he told the story of his grub-staked partner. He
fell easily into the vernacular of the gold-fields.</p>

<p>"Four years ago Weimer went prospecting
among the Shoshones in Wyoming over near
Yellowstone Park. There he began development
work on some deserted claims, a few miles from
Miners&#8217; Camp."</p>

<p>Here Grant pulled a letter from his pocket, and
consulted it.</p>

<p>"The claims, it seems," he continued, "had
been originally worked by two men named Allen
and Waymart McKenzie. They did the required
work for three years, and then threw up their job
and left Wyoming. Now they&#8217;re back again,
wishing, evidently, that they had never left."</p>

<p>Ross nodded. His eyes had not left his father&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>"Weimer has felt from the first that he would
make good on these claims. He has sent me
quartz from time to time, and I&#8217;ve had it assayed.
It carries moderately high values in gold, silver,
and lead; but, as the camp is eighty miles from a
railroad, up among almost impassable mountains,
where it&#8217;s impossible to get the quartz to a smelter,
I confess I have paid but little attention to Weimer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
work. It has seemed a waste of energy, despite his
enthusiasm."</p>

<p>Grant suddenly threw himself back in his chair.
His manner took on a keener edge, and his tone
became brisker.</p>

<p>"But this year things bid fair to change there
because the Burlington Railroad is surveying a
line from Cody, and a boom is in prospect for next
summer. Our claims have suddenly acquired a
new importance; they promise to become valuable."</p>

<p>"Then," commented Ross in a low, constrained
tone, "Weimer will get beyond a &#8217;start&#8217; at last."</p>

<p>Grant regarded his son keenly. He did not
answer the comment directly.</p>

<p>"According to the law of Wyoming," he continued,
"one hundred dollars&#8217; worth of work a
year for five years must be done on a claim, or
five hundred dollars&#8217; worth all together within
five years, before the tract can be patented, by
which I mean before the owners can receive a clear
title to it. Now, Weimer has done four years&#8217;
work all right; but this year, the fifth and last in
which he can hold the claims without fulfilling
the conditions of work to the full, he is failing
because of snow-blindness. It seems he had an
attack last spring, and was obliged to stay in his
cabin for weeks at a time instead of working."</p>

<p>Ross cleared his throat. "And if he fails<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>"We lose the claims, and the McKenzies get
them back." Grant again consulted the letter.
"Weimer got a man named Steele to write this&#8211;an
Amos Steele in Miners&#8217; Camp. He writes that
the McKenzies are taking advantage of some
technicalities in the law. They have already filed
a claim on the tract based on their three years&#8217;
former occupancy. This will clear the way for
them to take possession in case Weimer fails with
the work. Steele goes on to say that, if the claims
are saved, some one must come out and look after
them&#8211;preferably some one with a personal interest
in the property."</p>

<p>Mr. Grant laid the letter down, adding slowly,
"If you go, I shall give you a substantial personal
interest."</p>

<p>There ensued a pause. Ross sat motionless.
His gaze had left his father&#8217;s face, and was fixed
on the rug.</p>

<p>"Now, knowing," Grant continued, "that
Weimer has set his heart on these claims, I can&#8217;t
desert him. That work must be done and the
claims patented."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Grant looked at his
son expectantly, but still Ross neither moved nor
spoke.</p>

<p>"Weimer is a good sort," Grant went on tentatively.
"You&#8217;d like Weimer. He&#8217;s a big man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
and jolly in every pound of his avoirdupois. Great
story-teller&#8211;stories worth listening to, what&#8217;s
more. You wouldn&#8217;t be dull with him."</p>

<p>Grant leaned forward suddenly, and asked
directly the question to which his son felt there
could be but one reply in view of his father&#8217;s
appeal.</p>

<p>"My boy, will you go?"</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>A STEADY HAND</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>In</span> the two weeks which elapsed between Ross&#8217;s
visit to his father and his start for Wyoming he
planned hopefully for the year.</p>

<p>"Father has given me a free hand," he told his
uncle. "As soon as I can get the work done and
the claims patented I am at liberty to come back
home, and I tell you I shall hustle. I shall hire
as many men as are necessary in Miners&#8217; Camp,
and take &#8217;em over to Meadow Creek, where the
claims are located, and just rush that work
through."</p>

<p>"I wonder," remarked Dr. Grant thoughtfully,
"why that man Weimer doesn&#8217;t hire it done instead
of sending East for some one to manage the
matter."</p>

<p>Ross frowned into the open grate before which
the two were sitting. "Why, uncle, I never
thought of that, and father didn&#8217;t mention it. In
fact, he knows but very little about Miners&#8217; Camp
or Weimer&#8217;s work, and you know he hasn&#8217;t seen
Weimer in years. All he knows about the business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
is contained in a letter that Weimer got a man
named Amos Steele to write. Weimer, it seems,
can&#8217;t use his eyes to read or write. The letter is
very short. That man Steele is a mine-superintendent
out there. Father knows about the company
which he works for."</p>

<p>"The very idea," cried Aunt Anne a few moments
later in tearful indignation, "of Ross
Grant&#8217;s sending that boy away out West to the
jumping-off place into the wilderness without
knowing the conditions into which he&#8217;s sending
him! It&#8217;s a shame. He&#8217;s our boy, and I don&#8217;t
want him to go."</p>

<p>The doctor made no reply, but retired precipitately
to the office, where he had occupied himself
at intervals all day with fitting up an emergency
chest for Ross.</p>

<p>The chest was a little oblong, hair-covered strong
trunk, which had held all of the doctor&#8217;s worldly
possessions when, thirty years before, he had
started to the medical college just as his brother,
Ross&#8217;s father, had started West for his financial
"start." Into this chest uncle and nephew fitted
all sorts of objects medical, from books to bandages.</p>

<p>"When you&#8217;re eighty miles from a physician,
Ross, and shut in by snow-drifted mountains at
that, it&#8217;s well to have a few remedies and appliances
on hand."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>"And, when you&#8217;re several Sabbath days&#8217;
journey from civilization, with time to burn
on your hands, it&#8217;s also well to have some light
literature along," laughed Ross, tucking into the
chest Piersol&#8217;s "Histology." "I intend to make
my time count for myself, as well as for Weimer
and father."</p>

<p>Aunt Anne, meantime, was packing another
and more modern chest, her tears besprinkling the
contents.</p>

<p>"I have put your winter shirts and chamois-skin
vest right on top of the tray, Ross," she
sobbed as she bade him good-bye. "You better
put &#8217;em on as soon as you reach the mountains, as
it will be cold there."</p>

<p>"All right, aunt; I shall." Ross&#8217;s voice was a
little husky as he turned to his uncle.</p>

<p>Dr. Grant was standing beside the vacated
breakfast table absorbed in filling a glass of water.
Carefully he brimmed it drop by drop.</p>

<p>Aunt Anne peered through her tears. "Why,
Fred," she exclaimed, "what are you up to?
Don&#8217;t make Ross miss his train."</p>

<p>Calmly the doctor added a few more drops, and
then turned to his nephew. His eyes narrowed
intently as he motioned toward the glass.</p>

<p>"I want to test your nerves, Ross. Hold it
out," he directed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>The boy smiled confidently, raised the glass,
carried it from him the length of a long, steady
arm, and held it there. Then he returned it to
the table without spilling a drop.</p>

<p>The doctor grasped the hand that had held the
glass, looking earnestly into the boy&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>"Ross, the hand that holds the surgeon&#8217;s knife
successfully must <i>keep as steady as this</i>."</p>

<p>For a long, silent moment uncle and nephew
looked into each other&#8217;s faces as their hands
gripped. Ross made no reply, but in the expression
which leaped to his eyes the older man read
the resolution which satisfied him, and which
seemed a part of this slow, steady nephew of his.</p>

<p>An hour later the boy was being borne westward
on the way to Chicago and the "jumping-off place
into the wilderness."</p>

<p>At the same time his father sat behind his desk
on Broadway reading a letter postmarked Cody,
Wyo., and signed D. H. Leonard. It was written
in reply to a recent communication from Ross
Grant, Senior.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall be glad to do anything in
my power for your son," the letter read, "along
the lines you have suggested. I see the wisdom
of your move, too. It doesn&#8217;t always do to refuse
a boy&#8217;s demands point-blank. It&#8217;s far better to
turn him from his purpose as you are doing&#8211;or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
trying to do, I should say, because, if young Ross
is anything like old Ross, he will not be so easily
turned. Yet, as you say, a little stirring up and
jostling out of his uncle&#8217;s beaten tracks may put
some new ideas into his head. This country certainly
bids fair to be stirring enough now to fascinate
any young man. It&#8217;s a good idea also to give
him a half-share in your share of the claims; and
I&#8217;m sure, if the railroad makes good its promise
of a way up to Miners&#8217; Camp, the claims will be
worth working for. And, as a real estate dealer,
I don&#8217;t need to be urged to do my best to interest
him in the business of this vast land, the country
of the future."</p>

<p>In Chicago a telegram overtook Ross. It was
from his father. "Stop overnight at Hotel Irma,
Cody," it read. "Leonard will meet you there."</p>

<p>Two days later, early in the morning, the west
bound express dropped Ross Grant and half a
dozen other passengers at Toluca, in southern
Montana, a station with a water-tank and some
cattle corrals attached. Here stood the train which
by day plied over the branch road to Cody, and
by night returned to Toluca. It was a mixed
train consisting of freight and express cars with a
sleeper at the end.</p>

<p>The half dozen passengers, reënforced by others
left by the east bound express, all men, transferred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
themselves to this coach. Every one except Ross
seemed to be more or less acquainted with every
one else. Ross sat silent, listening and looking
out on as much of the great West as was visible
from the slowly moving car. Across the windswept,
sun-cracked plain grumbled the old engine.
On either side were herds of cattle fattening on the
dusty dried grass, which looked to Ross dead and
worthless. Not a tree met his eyes, and not a
house.</p>

<p>"Got the Western fever yet?" drawled a voice
behind him finally, and Ross looked around into
the good-natured face of a man who had boarded
the north bound express at Omaha.</p>

<p>Ross shook his head decidedly. "There&#8217;s nothing
here to give a fellow the Western fever," he
returned, pointing to the flat yellow plain overlaid
by the dull yellow sunshine.</p>

<p>The man lounged forward, his elbows on the
back of Ross&#8217;s seat, and grinned. He was apparently
about thirty, short and fair, with sandy
hair and mustache. He wore corduroy trousers
and coat, with a dark flannel shirt and turn-over
collar under which was knotted carelessly a broad
green silk tie. Hanging to the back of his head
was a brown, broad-brimmed hat, the crown encircled
with a narrow band of intricately woven
hair dyed in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>"I&#8217;ll tell ye what&#8217;s out there that gives most of
us the Western fever," he declared; "and that&#8217;s
money prospects. Sort of a yellow fever, ye know,
it is, except that no one wants to be cured."</p>

<p>"Then I don&#8217;t want to catch it in the first
place," declared Ross, looking out of the window
again.</p>

<p>Presently some one in the rear of the car lowered
a newspaper, and rumbled over the top of it:</p>

<p>"You fellers rec&#8217;lect old man Quinn?"</p>

<p>Some did; some did not. To the latter, the
speaker explained.</p>

<p>"Used to live in Cody. Friend of Buffalo Bill,
old man Quinn was. Went down to Oklahomy
five years ago, and bought a sheep ranch. He
and some of the cattlemen around him got by
the ears over how much of the range belonged to
the sheep<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Here an inarticulate murmur sounded through
the car. There was a "cattle war" on in Wyoming
at that time.</p>

<p>"Wall, one night two years ago about now, after
a big round-up at North Fork, one thousand of
old man Quinn&#8217;s sheep was driven over the bluffs
into North Fork River. All that old man Quinn
could find out was that four men done it. But
he kept a-tryin&#8217; to find out, and got a <i>de</i>tective
down from Kansas City, feller who used to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
cow puncher himself; and he nabbed three of &#8217;em.
They had had the gall to stay right there on the
range all this time."</p>

<p>"Good reason," volunteered some one, "why it
took so long to land &#8217;em. I suppose old man
Quinn was lookin&#8217; for &#8217;em among the punchers
that had left after the round-up."</p>

<p>"Jest so," declared the informant. "He was
tryin&#8217; to track up every one who cleared out after
the round-up&#8211;jest so."</p>

<p>"How long did they git?" asked some one
further up the aisle.</p>

<p>"Two years."</p>

<p>"Sandy," some one across the aisle said to the
man behind Ross, "wa&#8217;n&#8217;t you down t&#8217; Oklahomy
punchin&#8217; two year ago?"</p>

<p>There was a perceptible pause. Then a note of
irritation spoke through Sandy&#8217;s drawl as he answered
briefly, "No, north Texas."</p>

<p>And, while the rest continued the discussion
concerning old man Quinn, he leaned forward and
devoted himself to Ross.</p>

<p>Presently they came to the hills whose barrenness
and sombreness were relieved at intervals by
the brilliant coloring of the rocks.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Sandy, "what do ye think of
this? It ain&#8217;t every day East that ye can walk
around the crater of an old volcano."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>"Is this<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" began Ross, his head out of the
window.</p>

<p>"This is!" chuckled he of the sandy hair.</p>

<p>The train was crawling slowly around the edge
of a wide, shallow well, on all sides of which the
hills frowned darkly, stripped of every vestige of
verdure.</p>

<p>"An extinct volcano!" ejaculated Ross.</p>

<p>"Yep,"&#8211;the other sagged forward until his
laughing face was close to Ross&#8217;s,&#8211;"but just let
me tell ye right here, young man, that volcanoes
is the only thing in the West that&#8217;s extinct.
Everything else is pretty lively."</p>

<p>Ross joined in the laugh which greeted this
sally all around him. The man opposite lowered
his paper, and looked over his glasses.</p>

<p>"Volcanoes <i>and</i> hopes, Sandy," he amended
quickly, instantly retiring again behind his paper.</p>

<p>Ross did not understand the significance of the
retort, but he noticed that several men around exchanged
glances and that Sandy&#8217;s face lost a fraction
of its good nature. And when Sandy&#8217;s face
lost its humorous expression, it was not pleasing.</p>

<p>Dusk and Cody drew near together. The train
dropped over the "rim," and steamed along
through the Big Horn Basin, coming to a final
standstill in front of another station and water-tank.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>"Cody," announced the brakeman. "All out."</p>

<p>Ross, suitcase in hand, his top-coat over his
arm, stumbled out of the train, still swaying with
the perpetual motion of the last few days. A big
open wagon with side seats stood beside the platform.
At the call of the driver Ross looked around
interrogatively at Sandy, who was still beside him.</p>

<p>"Oh, we&#8217;re two miles from the town yet,"
Sandy replied to the look. "Pile in. Train can&#8217;t
make it over the shelves between here and Stinkin&#8217;
Water."</p>

<p>Ross silently "piled in." Sandy sat down beside
him, and the wagon filled with the other passengers.</p>

<p>Behind them, stretching back into the darkness,
their heads sagging sleepily, was a row of teams,
their neck-yokes joined by a chain, their heads
connected by a single rein running through the
ring at the left side of the bit.</p>

<p>"Hey, there," called one of the men in the
wagon, "does Grasshopper strike the trail to-night
for Meeteetse?"</p>

<p>"Yep," came a voice beside a lantern which was
traveling to and fro. "There&#8217;s a lot of freight to
pack up to Miners&#8217; Camp; and, if it gits there
ahead of the snow, these freighters have got to hit
the pike more rapid than they have been doin&#8217;."</p>

<p>A horseman dashed past the wagon and into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
circle of light from the lantern hung in front of
the station. Dropping the reins to the ground, he
swung his leather-enveloped legs off the horse,
and yelled at the station agent:</p>

<p>"Have those boxes of apples come yet?"</p>

<p>"Just here," replied the holder of the moving
light.</p>

<p>"Can&#8217;t you start &#8217;em up by the Meeteetse stage
to-night?" demanded the newcomer. "The boys
are about famished."</p>

<p>"Them surveyors," complained the agent, "are
always hollerin&#8217; for more grub. &#8217;N&#8217; no matter
how much ye fill &#8217;em, they don&#8217;t go faster than
molasses in January. Ain&#8217;t got beyond Sagehen
Roost this minute, and they&#8217;ll probably be a-quittin&#8217;
in a month."</p>

<p>Ross pricked up his ears. The same interest
was manifested by Sandy.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t you worry about our quitting," the newcomer
returned brusquely; "if the Burlington
Railroad starts out to run a track up to Miners&#8217;
Camp, why, it will run one, that&#8217;s all, if the track
has to go under snow-sheds all the way up from
the Meadows."</p>

<p>At this point the big open bus rumbled off over
the dust-choked "shelf" toward Cody. An unwieldy
swaying coach drawn by four horses passed
them on its way to the station.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>"Meeteetse stage is late to-night," remarked
Sandy.</p>

<p>On rumbled the wagon. Its brake screamed
against the wheel as the horses plunged down the
steep inclines which marked the descent from one
"shelf" to another. Presently a vile odor greeted
Ross&#8217;s nostrils, and at the same time the wagon
struck the bridge over the sulphurated waters of the
Shoshone, and began the climb on the other side.</p>

<p>Ross was keenly alive to this strange new world
in which the convenience of the East met the
newness and crudeness of the West. Brilliant
electric lights illuminated dust-deep, unpaved, unsprinkled
streets. Tents stood beside pretentious
homes, and stone business blocks were rising beside
offices located in canvas wagons with rounded
tops. And to and fro past the wagon flashed
horsemen, cowboys dressed like Sandy except that
their corduroy trousers were incased in leather
"chaps."</p>

<p>Sandy, watching Ross out of the corner of his
eye, grinned at the boy&#8217;s expression.</p>

<p>"Buck up here, tenderfoot," he advised good-naturedly.
"This here is &#8217;The Irma&#8217;; and, if
you&#8217;ve got any better hotels in the East, why,
don&#8217;t tell Colonel Cody of it, at any rate, for &#8217;The
Irma&#8217; is the Colonel&#8217;s pet."</p>

<p>Then Ross found himself in the foyer of "The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
Irma," the hotel that "Buffalo Bill" erected to
honor his home town, which bears his name, a
comfortable, modernly equipped house decorated
with hundreds of paintings, water colors, and etchings,
all picturing the scenes in Colonel Cody&#8217;s life
as represented in his "Wild West Show."</p>

<p>Sandy had registered in advance of Ross, and
stepped to a swinging door at the end of the
counter. There he stopped and turned back.
"Come on and have a drink, tenderfoot," he invited
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Ross was writing his name, and did not look
up. "No, thank you," he returned quietly. "I
don&#8217;t drink."</p>

<p>Several men lounging about glanced curiously
at the boy. Sandy thrust his hands into his
pockets, and, leaning against the counter, looked
at him in open interest.</p>

<p>After Ross had registered, he drew a nickel from
his pocket and laid it on the counter. "A two-cent
stamp, please."</p>

<p>The clerk, impatient with the deliberation of
his movements, cast the nickel hurriedly into
the cash drawer and handed out a stamp. Ross
waited for the change, while three men behind
him pressed forward to the register.</p>

<p>Sandy grinned broadly. "There&#8217;s no change
comin&#8217;, tenderfoot," he said with a chuckle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
"You&#8217;ve reached a land where nothin&#8217; less&#8217;n a
nickel can be got outside a post-office."</p>

<p>"Pennies don&#8217;t grow in the Rocky Mountains,"
added the clerk in a tone which plainly invited
the boy to move on.</p>

<p>The tone brought the blood to Ross&#8217;s cheek.
His eyes suddenly narrowed. His head went up,
and his voice quickened and deepened.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," he returned coolly, "give
me another two-cent stamp and a postal card."</p>

<p>Sandy patted his thigh softly. "You&#8217;ll pass,
tenderfoot," he murmured. "No flies on you&#8211;at
least, they don&#8217;t stick there."</p>

<p>Ross took his trophies, and retired to a desk beside
the swinging door. Just as he had finished
directing a letter to his Aunt Anne he noticed
that his new friend was waiting again beside the
counter.</p>

<p>When the last man had registered, Sandy pulled
the book toward him and leaned over it. Suddenly
he bent lower, and jabbed hard on the page
with his forefinger. When he turned, all the good
humor had dropped out of his face. With a glance
of keen interest at the boy beside the desk he
passed on into the barroom.</p>

<p>So marked was the change in his manner that Ross
paused in the act of dipping his pen into
the ink-well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>"Guess I&#8217;ll see who Sandy is," he thought, and,
dropping his pen, crossed to the book.</p>

<p>The name stared up at him in big bold letters
directly above his own, but he had not noticed it
at the time of registering.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>"Allen McKenzie, Miners&#8217; Camp."</i></p>
</div>

<p>Ross pursed his thin lips, and nearly whistled
aloud as he returned to his desk.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s one of the McKenzies who are after our
claims," he wrote at the end of a long letter to his
uncle and aunt; "but he is a funny, good-natured
fellow. I partly like him and partly don&#8217;t. He
has no six-shooter in sight&#8211;in fact, I&#8217;m told that
six-shooters have gone more or less out of fashion
in Wyoming; and he doesn&#8217;t look a bit as I had
imagined a &#8217;claim-jumper&#8217; would. But one thing
he may reckon on; there will be no chance for
him or any one else to jump the Weimer-Grant
claims in a few months."</p>

<p>And, sealing this confident declaration, he
slipped the letter into the mail-box, ate a hearty
dinner, and went to bed.</p>

<p>The following morning at nine o&#8217;clock D. H.
Leonard, his father&#8217;s old-time friend, appeared,
and greeted the son most cordially. Mr. Leonard
was a man of middle age, hale, red-faced, bald-headed,
and wearing a "boiled" shirt and collar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
He was a dealer in real estate, with offices in both
Cody and Basin. It was to his office that he first
took Ross.</p>

<p>"We&#8217;ll go for a drive by and by," he began,
throwing himself back in his chair and tossing
a cigar across the desk. "We have the country
of the future here, and I want you to see
it. Perfect gold-mine in this land once it&#8217;s irrigated."</p>

<p>Ross picked up the cigar, played with it a
moment, and laid it again on the desk, listening
attentively.</p>

<p>The older man drew a match across the woodwork
beneath his chair, and lighted his cigar.
"It&#8217;s <i>the</i> place for young men, Grant, a greater
place than it was when Horace Greeley gave his
advice to young men to go West&#8211;here&#8217;s a match,"
he interrupted himself to say.</p>

<p>Ross accepted the match, bit on the end of it a
moment, and laid it beside the cigar.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t you smoke?" asked Leonard in some
surprise.</p>

<p>Before Ross could reply, some one called Mr.
Leonard out into the hall. As the door closed
behind him, Ross arose and stood silently in front
of the open window. Beyond the little town and
beyond the level stretch of "shelves" arose the
Big Horn Mountains, miles away, but so sharply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
outlined in the clear air that they seemed only a
short walk distant.</p>

<p>As Ross leaned against the window-casing, some
one in the room adjoining came to the open window.
The stub of a cigar was thrown out, and a voice
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But if Grant realized the situation, he&#8217;d never
have sent a boy out here to look after those claims.
And it looks as though it was his son&#8211;same
initials. But with such a boy and Weimer you
ought to be able<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>The speaker left the window at this point, and
Ross lost the rest of the sentence. In a few moments,
however, some one clattered through the
hall and down the stairs, with spurs jingling. A
horse stood on the street below, tethered only by
its bridle-reins dangling to the ground. From the
entrance to the building Sandy McKenzie emerged,
clad as on the previous day, except for a colored
handkerchief knotted about his neck. Mounting
his pony, he touched a spur to its flank, and galloped
away in a cloud of dust just as Leonard
returned.</p>

<p>"Who&#8217;s in the next room?" asked Ross.</p>

<p>"Over on the right?" asked Leonard carelessly.
"Oh, a lawyer has that office." He crossed to the
window, and glanced out just as McKenzie disappeared.
"Evidently Sandy&#8217;s pulling out for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
mountains," he observed. "Miners&#8217; Camp, that
is."</p>

<p>"Are there only two McKenzies?" asked Ross.</p>

<p>Leonard shrugged his shoulders. "Two are all
that have ever showed up around here&#8211;Sandy and
Waymart; but they say there are half a dozen
more brothers and cousins, some figurin&#8217; under
names not their own; but where they put up I
don&#8217;t know."</p>

<p>Here he turned and looked curiously at Ross.
"I suppose your father told you that Sandy and
Waymart are sitting up on Meadow Creek waiting
to jump the Grant-Weimer claims."</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me," answered Ross, and hesitated.
"Do they use guns in the jumping process?"</p>

<p>Leonard laughed. "Not much! They have
other and safer methods of getting their own way
in case Weimer doesn&#8217;t do the work the law requires
this year."</p>

<p>Then he glanced at the unsmoked cigar, and
repeated his question of some time before. "Don&#8217;t
you smoke?"</p>

<p>Ross shook his head shortly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Leonard looked at his old friend&#8217;s
son in friendly interest.</p>

<p>Ross stretched out his right arm in an unconscious
imitation of the test his uncle had required
of him only a few mornings before. "It&#8217;s apt to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
get on a fellow&#8217;s nerves," was all the reply he
made.</p>

<p>There was much to see during the day and much
to hear. Leonard took the boy for a long drive
up the cañon of the Shoshone, whose densely green
waters have a background of brilliant reds and
yellows in the sandstone sides of the wall through
which the river has cut. Up and yet up the
carriage went, with the walls rising higher and
higher on either side, the road a mere thread
blasted out of the rocks, up to the great dam
which was beginning to raise its head across the
river bed to hold back the water and distribute it
over Big Horn Basin through irrigating canals.</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s interest, however, during the drive was
divided. He was glad to see the vast "Shoshone
Project," as the government reservoir is called;
but his most active thoughts were following Sandy
McKenzie on his way to Miners&#8217; Camp, and his
questions were of the Camp and Wyoming mining
laws and the conditions he would meet in this new
and strange land.</p>

<p>But Leonard had never been up to Camp, and
was not interested in mining, but in ranch lands;
therefore, Ross got but little enlightenment from
him, and finally, ceasing to question, listened in
silence while the older man, in obedience to the
senior Grant&#8217;s request, did his best to interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
the junior Grant in the business prospects of
Wyoming.</p>

<p>"I want you to come down to Basin at Christmas,"
Leonard said cordially as host and guest sat
down to dinner in the dining-room of "The Irma"
at six o&#8217;clock that night. "My home is in Basin.
It&#8217;s the county-seat of Big Horn County, you know;
and I want you to come down there. I want to
show you more of this magnificent country."</p>

<p>Ross was grateful for this friendly invitation, but
made no promises; and presently the two were eating
in silence, Ross looking with interest on some
of the contrasts which were too familiar for Leonard
even to notice.</p>

<p>Under elaborate and gaudy chandeliers was a
bare and not overclean floor. Looking down on
the thickest and heaviest of cracked china were
pictures by well-known artists. Seated around the
tables spread in linen, were bearded men in chaps
and overalls, flannel shirts and spurs, together with
those in tan oxfords and broadcloth.</p>

<p>At the table opposite Ross, and facing him, was
a man to whom his glance returned again and
again. He sat alone. His square, unexpressive
face was relieved by a pair of fine dark-brown eyes.
The lower part of his face was covered by a stubby
reddish beard. His hair was brown, and fell
nearly to his eyes, giving him the appearance of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
having a low forehead. He wore a coat,&#8211;the first
of its kind Ross had seen,&#8211;a short, bulky affair,
with a high collar laid over the shoulders and lined
throughout with lambskin, the wool badly worn
on the collar. His chaps were of undressed leather,
with the long hair trimmed short save from the
thigh to the ankle. High riding boots, spurs, and
a sombrero, which he wore low over his forehead
while eating, completed his costume.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Ross.</p>

<p>Mr. Leonard shook his head. "Man next to me
here said he rode in this afternoon on the Yellowstone
trail. Don&#8217;t know who he is."</p>

<p>As if he felt he was under discussion, the stranger
raised his head, and his eyes met Ross&#8217;s in a quick
furtive glance.</p>

<p>After dinner Leonard gripped Ross&#8217;s hand in
farewell, and left. An hour later there was a rattle
of wheels in front of the hotel, the sound of
horses&#8217;s hoofs, and a rollicking voice called:</p>

<p>"Meeteetse stage. All aboard!"</p>

<p>Ross, with a glance around the office which he
expected to see again before spring, picked up his
bag, and went out on the piazza. Here he stood
while his trunk and the emergency chest were
swung up behind the stage and roped. Then he
climbed up beside the driver, who was glad to have
some one near to help him keep awake during the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
long night ride, and they were off, only to be
stopped almost immediately by a man standing in
the doorway of a store.</p>

<p>"Hold up there!" shouted the man. "Steele
is here, and wants to go on to-night."</p>

<p>The name caught Ross&#8217;s attention. "Is it Amos
Steele?" he asked the driver.</p>

<p>The driver assented. "Yep&#8211;superintendent of
the Gale&#8217;s Ridge Mine up in Camp."</p>

<p>Ross leaned forward and surveyed with interest
the pleasant-faced, well-dressed, squarely-built
young man who came out of the store and climbed
into the stage. In his pocket Ross had the letter
Steele had written his father at Weimer&#8217;s request.</p>

<p>"Git out of this," the driver requested briefly of
his four bronchos as the stage door slammed to,
and the four obligingly "got out" on a run.</p>

<p>Just as they left the last house behind them, a
figure on horseback whirled by in a cloud of dust,
and Ross recognized in the sheepskin coat and
hairy chaps the stranger who had attracted his attention
during dinner.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>DOC TENDERFOOT IN ACTION</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Besides</span> Steele, there were three other passengers
inside the stage that night. One was the assistant
manager of the Embar Ranch, south of Meeteetse.
He had been to Omaha with a car-load of cattle.
The remaining two were miners whom Steele had
picked up in Butte. This much Ross learned from
the driver. He learned many other things by
listening to the conversation between Hillis, the
manager, and Steele, although all the while he was
keenly observant of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The stage was bowling along smoothly over a
road as level as a floor and flooded by brilliant
moonlight. Behind them Cody faded into silvery
mist, guarded by the huge shadowy bulks of the
Big Horn Mountains. Ahead, houseless and treeless,
stretched the shelf until the shimmering mist
cut off the sight. And in the distance, so far
ahead that sometimes he blended with the mist,
rode the horseman in the sheepskin coat.</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Andy," called the ranch-manager;
"who is that fellow ahead?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>Andy, the driver, turned, and looked down
through the open flap into the cavernous darkness
of the stage. "Don&#8217;t know. Didn&#8217;t find out. I
have seen fellers, though, that can give more information
about themselves per square inch than that
same chap ahead there."</p>

<p>"I never saw &#8217;im in these parts before," returned
Hillis.</p>

<p>"Nor I." The driver spat over the flank of the
right wheeler. "Gid&#8217;ep there, Suke, ye slowmy,
you! Hike it, old Blue! Git out of this!" And,
having thus jogged the energy of the leaders, Andy
gave his attention again to Hillis. "Hain&#8217;t ever
set eyes on that brown chap before. I guessed
back there he was bound fer Embar. Looks like
a puncher."</p>

<p>"I wish"&#8211;the assistant manager of the Embar
spoke forcefully&#8211;"that he and seven or eight more
were bound for the Embar."</p>

<p>"Short of hands, eh?" questioned Andy, whirling
his "black snake" so skilfully that the lash
missed the heads of the wheelers, and touched the
flank of the nigh leader.</p>

<p>"Short of hands?" Steele broke in. "Who
isn&#8217;t short of hands from Butte to Omaha&#8211;especially
in Wyoming? I&#8217;ve been out two weeks
advertising and hunting men, and here I am back
again with two only."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>Ross turned half around in his high seat, and
grasped the low back. "Is labor as scarce as that
in Miners&#8217; Camp?" he burst out in a brusque, astonished
tone which betrayed a personal interest.</p>

<p>"As scarce as diamonds," returned Steele, adding
with a laugh, "and almost as expensive."</p>

<p>Andy pushed back his hat, and surveyed his
young companion with curiosity. There was a
little stir in the coach also.</p>

<p>"It must be"&#8211;Amos Steele spoke as if the
matter had been debated before&#8211;"that you are
related to Ross Grant of New York."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Ross, "I am his son."</p>

<p>He was conscious of becoming an immediate
centre of speculation.</p>

<p>"I wondered," remarked Steele, "when I saw
your name on the hotel register. Going out to
Camp, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Ross hesitated. "In answer to that letter
you wrote father for Mr. Weimer."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Steele&#8217;s tone was edged with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Come out to see to the work, did ye?" asked
Andy.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Andy glanced sidewise, and Ross caught the look
of incredulity.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i2'></a><img src='images/i-059.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>"Expected to hire men to do it, did ye?" That
Andy was a general information bureau was due
to his faculty for asking questions.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," emphatically.</p>

<p>The present tense of the reply did not escape the
listener&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>"Weimer has tried to hire," volunteered Steele;
"but it&#8217;s no use."</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, as I said, there hain&#8217;t
enough men to supply the demand; and, in the
second place, no man in his senses is going away
over on the Creek, where he&#8217;ll be shut in for
months, when he can just as well stay down in
Camp, and get the same wages."</p>

<p>"Shut in for months?" repeated Ross slowly.</p>

<p>Andy explained. "Along about first of February
ye&#8217;re shut in fer sartain. Trail fills up, and
there&#8217;s apt to be snowslides any time on old
Crosby."</p>

<p>Ross sat with widening eyes staring out into
the moonlight, and wondering with tightening
muscles what he was "up against." The vagueness
of his father&#8217;s knowledge concerning Weimer&#8217;s
work had not counted in New York. But here,
swinging along toward Miners&#8217; Camp with two-thirds
of the width of the continent between himself
and his friends, Ross realized that this vagueness
had put him at a disadvantage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>The two men behind him began discussing the
cattle market, and the stage slid down the side of
the first mesa of the Wyoming bad lands and into
the coulee, or dry creek, at the bottom. The level
road was left behind. Up hill and down plunged
the horses ahead of the rocking, tipping stage.
There was no regular road. A dozen tracks
showed the differing routes of as many drivers.
To Ross it seemed as if destruction were imminent
every time they came to the top of one of the
short, steep hills. But Andy jammed on the
brake hard, and, giving a peculiar little whistle,
yelled carelessly, "Git out of this."</p>

<p>Presently Andy took advantage of the rattle of
wheels and hoofs to say to Ross: "Steele is boss
of the Gale&#8217;s Ridge work up to Camp. They keep
open all winter; t&#8217;other company shuts down."</p>

<p>"Shuts down?" repeated Ross.</p>

<p>"Yep, has to. Men go down t&#8217; Cody t&#8217; work on
the Project. Hard work to keep men in Camp
through the winter. When the railroad goes up
there, &#8217;twill be different."</p>

<p>Some one inside the stage struck a match.</p>

<p>"On time, ain&#8217;t you, Andy?" asked Steele&#8217;s
voice; "it&#8217;s twelve-thirty."</p>

<p>"Yep," returned the driver. "Here&#8217;s Dry
Creek."</p>

<p>The road, a well-defined track here, was hemmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
in between a creek-bed on one hand and a hill on
the other. On top of the hill, silhouetted against
the star-studded sky, appeared a wagon with a
white bellying canvas top. Around it, covering
the hilltop and the side clear down to the track
was a soft white moving mass that caused Ross to
give a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>"Why&#8211;that looks like&#8211;it <i>is</i> sheep!" he ejaculated.
"Sheep by the hundreds."</p>

<p>"Sheep&#8217;s the word!" returned the driver.
"This is Sheepy&#8217;s layout. That&#8217;s his wagon up
yon. He herds fer parties in Cody. There&#8217;s nigh
seven hundred of them sheep. Never seen such a
flock before, did ye?"</p>

<p>Before Ross could reply, the stage swung around
a corner of the hill and Andy, with a sharp
whistle, drew up the leaders abruptly. They
were in an open space in front of the stage camp,
half cabin and half dugout driven into the hillside.
Beside the dugout was a low, stout corral,
outside of which were a haystack and a jumble of
bales of hay. As the stage stopped, the door of the
dugout opened, and a man loomed large against
a dim light within.</p>

<p>But all this Ross did not notice at the time. His
attention was riveted on the horse just ahead ridden
by the stranger. Around and around it whirled,
unmindful of the quirt and spur of the rider.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>"Pretty ridin&#8217;," remarked Andy, spitting appreciatively
over the wheel.</p>

<p>The men inside the stage clambered out with
grunts at their stiffened limbs, and leaned against
the wheels watching. The man in the doorway
stepped out, and thrust his hands into his pockets,
and looked calmly while the horse placed its four
feet together and humped its back with a momentum
which sent the rider high in the air.</p>

<p>When he came down, he settled himself in the
saddle, drew up on the reins, and dug his spurs
into the horse&#8217;s flank. The animal, his nostrils
distended and the foam flying from his mouth,
without any warning rose on his hind legs, and
threw himself backward. The rider freed one
foot from the stirrup; but the other caught, and
horse and rider went down in a heap. There was
a deep groan from both, and then silence. If the
men had seemed indifferent before, they made up
in activity now. With a flying leap Andy was
down from his high seat. The stage-camp man
rushed forward, and threw himself on the horse&#8217;s
head, while the others pulled the unconscious
rider from beneath the animal&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>"Leg&#8217;s done for," Ross heard Steele say as they
carried the wounded man into the dugout.</p>

<p>Ross clambered awkwardly down from his seat,
and followed. He nearly fell over an empty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
chicken-coop and into the one little room of the
dugout.</p>

<p>"Put &#8217;im here," directed the stage-camp man,
whom the others called Hank. He pointed to the
blankets in the corner from which he had crawled
ten minutes before.</p>

<p>"Here, boy," Steele said with pale-faced absorption,
"smooth the blankets up."</p>

<p>Ross, half dazed by his strange and unexpected
surroundings, slowly and clumsily did as he was
directed, and they laid the unconscious stranger
down carefully, his left leg hanging limply from a
point half-way between knee and hip. Then the
men straightened up, and looked at one another.</p>

<p>"A bad job," muttered Hank.</p>

<p>"Take &#8217;im back to Cody?" asked Steele.</p>

<p>Hillis shook his head. "Doctor there went to
Thermopolis this morning."</p>

<p>Suddenly the daze which had beclouded Ross&#8217;s
brain cleared away. He woke up, and his whole
attention focused itself on the prostrate man. In
a moment he became alert, resourceful, and active.
His boyish hesitation fell from him. He threw
off his top-coat, tossed his cap with it to the uncovered
board table, and, kneeling by the man&#8217;s
side, laid his ear on the heart.</p>

<p>"Go out," he said authoritatively to the astonished
men, "and bring in my smallest trunk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
Hurry, for this chap will be conscious in just a
moment."</p>

<p>No one stirred.</p>

<p>Whipping out his jack-knife, Ross cut a strap
which secured the chaps, and caught one leg at the
ankle. "Help me pull &#8217;em off," he cried urgently.</p>

<p>Some one stooped to the other foot, and the
chaps were off. Kneeling beside the wounded leg,
with his knife, Ross ripped the trousers from ankle
to thigh, and exposed a bloody wound.</p>

<p>"Compound fracture," he exclaimed after a brief
examination.</p>

<p>Then he looked up. "Where&#8217;s that chest?" he
demanded. "I must cleanse this and bandage it
at once."</p>

<p>The cock-sureness of the boy&#8217;s tone and the
sight of the skilful touch of his fingers on the
wound galvanized the two miners into action, and
in a moment the emergency chest was beside Ross.</p>

<p>"Hot water," was his next command, as he
fumbled with the key, "and a small dish"&#8211;his
eye fell on the table&#8211;"that salt cellar, with every
grain of salt washed out. Quick!"</p>

<p>The wounded man had recovered consciousness
now, and was groaning, and clinching his fists,
and rolling his head from side to side in agony.</p>

<p>"Are you a doctor?" asked Steele incredulously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>"My uncle is," Ross returned briefly, "and I&#8217;m
going to be."</p>

<p>The answer, coupled with a view of the contents
of the chest and Ross&#8217;s manipulation of those contents,
brought relief to the men.</p>

<p>He had produced a hypodermic syringe, and
with a tiny morphine tablet dissolved in the salt
cellar he began operations which lasted the greater
part of two hours, and employed every man present.</p>

<p>"Bring in that hen-coop," directed Ross; "we
can use that for a double inclined plane to stretch
the leg over."</p>

<p>Steele, who had so recently issued orders to a
slow and clumsy boy, now quietly obeyed this
embryo surgeon. Hillis was holding bandages,
while Hank and Andy were doing something
which filled their souls with wonder, namely,
making long, narrow bags from grain sacks out of
which wheat had been hastily dumped.</p>

<p>"By the great horn spoon, what&#8217;re these fer?"
Andy demanded in an undertone, running the big
needle deep into his thumb. "Jehoshaphat!"</p>

<p>Hank shook his head helplessly. He plumped
a stick of wood into his rusty old stove, and refilled
a kettle from a water pail which stood on a
box. Steele dragged in the triangular chicken-coop,
and laid it beside the wounded man, who was
moaning mechanically and drowsily now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>Ross arose, and set a bottle of alcohol on the table.
He looked critically at the coop. "The very
thing," he muttered with eyes alight. "How fortunate
that I fell over it coming in!" Then he
paused in thought.</p>

<p>Miners&#8217; Camp and Meadow Creek were forgotten.
Forgotten were Weimer and the neglected work.
A "case" lay before him, a man needing the help
that it was life for the boy to give.</p>

<p>When, at last, the belated stage was ready to
move on, the men, again in their overcoats, lined
up and looked down at the sleeping patient. He
lay with the knee of the wounded leg over the
peak of the chicken-coop, padded thick and soft
with blankets, the leg held secure and motionless
between heavy sand-bags. Down the leg from knee
to foot on either side ran strips of adhesive plaster
with loops protruding below the foot. And attached
to the loops was a small bag loaded with stone.</p>

<p>"To reduce the fracture," Ross explained briefly.
He was on his knees, measuring the well leg with
a tape measure from the haircloth trunk. "See,
this leg is longer now because the broken parts of
the thigh bone in the other have been driven past
each other, and the muscles have contracted, shortening
the leg. The weight on the foot will stretch
the muscles and allow the ends of the bone to meet
again."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>"Jehoshaphat!" exclaimed Andy softly. "He&#8217;s
lucky to have you come trailin&#8217; down the pike just
behind &#8217;im. But see here, fellers," the driver
turned to the others; "yer Uncle Samuel will dock
me this time sure, fer the mail won&#8217;t reach Meeteetse
in time fer the stage up to Miners&#8217; Camp!"</p>

<p>"Miners&#8217; Camp!"</p>

<p>The exclamation burst involuntarily from Ross.
He arose. The tape measure dropped from his
hands. He drew his hand across his wet forehead.
He had seen the stage load prepare to go on without
a thought that he ought to go also. His one
idea had been the care of the nameless man on the
blankets.</p>

<p>"Miners&#8217; Camp," he repeated; "why, I ought to
go on!"</p>

<p>"Not much," cried Hank in lively alarm.
"What &#8217;ud I do with him and all that toggery?"
jerking his thumb over his shoulder at the chicken-coop.</p>

<p>"Of course," was Ross&#8217;s decision in a low tone,
"I can&#8217;t desert him&#8211;but I ought to go on."</p>

<p>A few moments later, Andy&#8217;s four bronchos
pounded up the hill beyond the stage camp and
disappeared, leaving Ross standing beside the window
watching. The man on the blankets breathed
heavily. A big yellow cat purred around Ross&#8217;s
legs. Hank poked the fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>"Guess I&#8217;ll rustle some grub now," the latter
said in awkward solicitude. "Ye&#8217;re all in, ain&#8217;t
ye, Doc?"</p>

<p>Ross turned from the window wearily without
replying, and for the first time looked about the
cabin.</p>

<p>It was roughly boarded, with a hard dirt floor.
In addition to the bench, the only seats were boxes
in which "canned goods" had been stored away.
A pile of wood lay behind an old stove propped
up on boxes in lieu of legs. A cupboard containing
some tin cups and thick plates, a few pans
and skillets, and a shelf heaped with magazines
half a year old completed the furnishings of the
room.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ross&#8217;s eyes lighted on the wounded
man&#8217;s sheepskin coat, which had been cast hurriedly
aside on the floor. Lifting it, he stepped to
the door, and commenced to shake it energetically.
Out of the breast pocket fell a small object. It hit
the stone in front of the door with a metallic ring.
Ross picked it up, and looked down into the photographed
face of a winning girl with smiling eyes,
curved lips, and plump cheeks. The picture was
a little oval set in a gilt frame. On the back in a
girlish hand was written the inscription, "To Lon
Weston."</p>

<p>"Weston, huh?" came Hank&#8217;s voice at Ross&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
elbow. "I never heard of Lon Weston before.
Wonder where he hails from."</p>

<p>Hank glanced speculatively at the sleeper, then
took a deep earthenware dish from the cupboard,
beat its contents with a spoon, greased a skillet,
and set it on the fire.</p>

<p>"Men fergot t&#8217; eat," he grumbled, "&#8217;n&#8217; fergot t&#8217;
feed the horses. They fergot everything except
him. They&#8217;ll be one hungry lot when they land
in Meeteetse."</p>

<p>He raised the smoking skillet, and gave a deft
toss, which sent the flapjack spinning into the
air, turned it over, and settled it back with the
baked side uppermost.</p>

<p>"Nice-looking girl that!" he muttered absently,
immediately adding, "Here ye are&#8211;flapjacks &#8217;n&#8217;
coffee!"</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the injured man aroused
himself groaning. He stared at Ross with eyes
which gradually cleared as a realization of his
environment was borne in on him.</p>

<p>"I say, Doc," he muttered, biting his lips with
the pain, "I&#8217;m all to the bad, ain&#8217;t I?"</p>

<p>"Leg&#8217;s used up for a few days, that&#8217;s all, Mr.
Weston," returned Ross cheerfully.</p>

<p>The man turned his head quickly. His eyes
widened and he seemed to forget his pain. For a
long moment he lay motionless looking from Ross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
to Hank, who grinned hospitably at him from the
stove.</p>

<p>"Cheer up down there," said Hank in jovial
strain, "the worst is yet t&#8217; come, fer I&#8217;m makin&#8217;
ye some puddin&#8217;, and even my mother &#8217;ud say
that puddin&#8217; ain&#8217;t one of my strong pints!"</p>

<p>The sick man did not smile. He merely stared
at the speaker until Hank disappeared, a water
pail in hand, bound for the spring. Then he
threw out a hand toward Ross and asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>Ross, turning a flapjack awkwardly, looked inquiringly
over his shoulder. "Get what?"</p>

<p>"The name&#8211;Weston?"</p>

<p>Ross smiled and then, partly because he was
embarrassed and partly because he thought the
injured man would be, turned his back before
answering, "A picture fell out of your coat and
I&#8211;we&#8211;saw the name written on the back, &#8217;Lon
Weston.&#8217;"</p>

<p>There was no reply, and presently Ross added,
"I put the photo back in your pocket and hung
the coat above your head there on the peg. Guess
you can reach it."</p>

<p>Still no reply, and Ross, looking around, found
his patient with head turned away, eyes closed and
lips pressed tightly together in his beard.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the open doorway appeared a figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
that Ross had not seen before. A shaggy head
was advanced cautiously within the cabin and
the owner peered at Weston curiously. Then, evidently
understanding his closed eyes to mean
sleep, the stranger backed out precipitately and
sat down on the bench outside the door. From
this vantage point he peered around the jamb from
time to time eyeing Ross and his patient in turn.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said the former as the stranger
showed no signs of speaking.</p>

<p>The shaggy head appeared in the doorway and
nodding briefly, was withdrawn, just as Hank,
coming with the water, called, "Well, Sheepy,
what&#8217;s the latest word up your way?"</p>

<p>It was Luther, otherwise "Sheepy," the herder
whose wagon crowned the adjacent hill. He was
Hank&#8217;s daily caller.</p>

<p>"There ye are, Doc," exclaimed Hank entering
with the water. "Puddin&#8217; fer Weston, and flapjacks
&#8217;n&#8217; coffee fer you and me with cabbage &#8217;n&#8217;
spuds thrown in. Fill up."</p>

<p>It was a menu which was not varied to any
great extent in the days which followed, strange
days for "Doc Tenderfoot," as Hank called Ross.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/i-072.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
"WHAT&#8217;S THE LATEST WORD?"
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>Every night at midnight one of the two stages
plying between Cody and Meeteetse stopped at the
stage camp for supper and horse feed. Every noon
the other stage stopped for dinner on its return
trip. Between times, horsemen came and went,
occasionally, men from the ranches on Wood River
and the Grey Bull, miners "packing" their beds
behind them, prospectors going out of the mountains
for the winter, and every day during the
first week there was Sheepy. Sheepy usually
came toward night when his flock had been
driven in from the range and rounded up by
the faithful shepherd dog near the canvas-topped
wagon.</p>

<p>One day, the last of the week, after Ross had
had a particularly trying time with his patient, he
left the latter asleep, and going outside, sat on the
bench in the sunshine watching Hank who was
repairing the corral. Presently Sheepy joined him,
first refreshing himself, as usual, with a long look
at the snoring Weston.</p>

<p>"Once I seen a feller that rode like him and
looked like him, only his hair and beard," Sheepy
announced finally in a hoarse whisper. "I seen
&#8217;im ridin&#8217; in ahead of th&#8217; stage that night, and I
thought &#8217;twas th&#8217; other chap."</p>

<p>Ross listened without interest. Sheepy filled a
pipe with deliberation and lighted it. Then, clasping
a worn knee in both hands he spoke again out
of the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"That feller had hair light as tow and his face
clean of beard, but he rode the same and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
eyes was the same. He was a puncher off the
cattle ranges. Used to ride past my wagon alone
about once a week headin&#8217; fer town. Went in the
edge of the evenin&#8217; always."</p>

<p>"And where were you?" asked Ross still without
interest.</p>

<p>"Down in Oklahomy. I was herdin&#8217; sheep fer
old man Quinn."</p>

<p>Ross looked at Sheepy with new interest. "I
heard the men on the train talking about old man
Quinn and the sheep that he lost. Were you there
at that time?"</p>

<p>Sheepy nodded. "I sartain was. That&#8217;s two
years gone by."</p>

<p>"And did you see what was going on&#8211;driving
the sheep into the river, I mean?" questioned Ross
eagerly.</p>

<p>The sheep-herder shook his grizzled head. "It
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t off my range that the sheep was drove, but
another feller&#8217;s called Happy. He seen there was
four men done it. It was night&#8211;dark night, and
they didn&#8217;t stop to say howdy ner make any introductions.
They shot Happy&#8217;s dog and got away
over the bluff with a thousand sheep. They was
drunk, all of &#8217;em, but not too drunk not t&#8217; know
what they was doin&#8217;. Old man Quinn got three
of &#8217;em. He&#8217;s been after the other ever since."</p>

<p>"Do you think he&#8217;ll be caught?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>Sheepy moved his shoulders helplessly. "Don&#8217;t
know. Old man Quinn he never lets up on a
thing. Took &#8217;im two years t&#8217; find three. Bet he
don&#8217;t give t&#8217;other up."</p>

<p>"Why did they drive the sheep over the bluff?"
asked Ross.</p>

<p>Sheepy frowned. "Cattlemen claimed the sheep
had crossed the dead line. Cattlemen are always
claimin&#8217; that, and they push the line further and
further in on the sheep and claim more of the
range every year. They do here. They did down
in Oklahomy. The sheep owners and cattlemen
had a row at the big cattle round-up on the North
Fork. It was after the round-up, when the cow
punchers was feelin&#8217; pretty gay and let themselves
loose, that them four drove old man Quinn&#8217;s sheep
over the bluff."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Sheepy went back
to the original subject. "The feller that looked
like him and rode like him," jerking his thumb
over his shoulder, "used to ride past when I was
shakin&#8217; grub in my wagon. He used t&#8217; go grinnin&#8217;
mostly and starin&#8217; at his hoss&#8217; ears. And he
alus went with his fixin&#8217;s on, tan chaps and a red
silk &#8217;kerchief &#8217;round his neck and Indian gloves
with these here colored gauntlets. Oh, he struck
the trail in his good togs all right&#8211;bet he went t&#8217;
see some girl &#8217;r other!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>This was the last information that Ross received
from Sheepy for several months. The following
morning there arrived from Cody a supply wagon
which replenished the sheep-herder&#8217;s larder, and
then, the sheep having eaten the range bare for
miles around the dugout, the canvas-topped wagon
was attached to the supply wagon and drawn to
another hilltop ten miles away. With it went
Sheepy only faintly regretting the loss of companionship
at the dugout. The seven hundred
sheep that his dog rounded up and drove in advance
of the wagons were the companions with
which he was best acquainted.</p>

<p>"It wouldn&#8217;t ha&#8217; been a bad idee," Hank remarked
when the last bleat died away in the distance,
"if Sheepy could ha&#8217; stayed all winter. He
ain&#8217;t generally long on talk&#8211;none of them herders
be&#8211;but he was some one t&#8217; have around, and once
in a while his tongue breaks loose."</p>

<p>Ross drew a long breath and thought of Meadow
Creek.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Hank resumed his repairs on
the corral, leaving Weston asleep and Ross kneeling
beside his medicine chest sorting its contents.</p>

<p>The sorting done, the boy arose noiselessly and
closed the lid of the chest. Then, turning, he
looked down on the head of the sleeper. For the
first time he noticed that Weston&#8217;s hair, thick and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
unkempt, was dull in color and had a dead look
at variance with its evident health. Tiptoeing
across the floor he bent over the recumbent man
and gently raising a lock of his hair looked wonderingly
at the roots. The sight caused him to
utter an exclamation which disturbed the sleeper.
He straightened himself and stepped back precipitately.</p>

<p>The hair was tow-colored at the roots.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FOURTH MAN</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span> stood motionless until Weston, muttering
and turning his head from side to side, gradually
came to rest again and fell into a deeper sleep. Then
the boy went outside and sat down on the bench.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s easy enough to put two and two together,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, he dropped his elbows on his
knees and taking his head between his hands,
proceeded to do some adding satisfactory in its
results. He longed for the presence of Sheepy.
Now he would question him with interest on the
subject of the puncher whose face was free from a
beard and whose hair was tow color. He wanted
more information on the subject of that cattle
round-up and of the process of getting those three
guilty cow punchers. Still, he believed that Sheepy
had told him enough to make it clear that Weston
was the fourth that old man Quinn was after.</p>

<p>"Some one that looked like Weston and rode
like him," Ross enumerated the points in the evidence,
"only the man in Oklahoma had no beard
and his hair was tow color."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>What was easier than to grow a beard&#8211;the hair
was already accounted for&#8211;it had been tow-colored
before its owner stained it a chestnut brown. And
why should he have colored it unless for purposes
of disguise? And why a disguise unless he was
guilty of a crime such as driving old man Quinn&#8217;s
sheep into the North Fork?</p>

<p>At this point in his reasoning, another fact
flashed into the boy&#8217;s mind&#8211;the strange way in
which Weston had acted about his name.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" exclaimed Ross aloud and then
checked his voice. "Probably he didn&#8217;t want us
to know his name, his real name," he thought.
"How all that dovetails together. If I could only
get hold of Sheepy now!"</p>

<p>On further reflection, however, he decided that
Sheepy could throw no more light on the subject.
It was evident that the herder did not know the
name of the puncher who had ridden alone past
his wagon, for he had not connected Weston&#8217;s name
with the other. Nor would Weston, if he were the
same puncher, be likely to recognize Sheepy who,
as he himself said, was in his wagon preparing
supper when the puncher, his eyes on his horse&#8217;s
ears, passed.</p>

<p>That night, when Ross rolled up in his blankets
beside Weston he was sure he was lying beside the
fourth cowboy of old man Quinn&#8217;s search. But in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
the cold clear dawn he was not so sure. It might
have been vanity that had led Weston to stain his
hair, tow not being a manly color. Then, too, even
if he had been on the North Fork, so were dozens
of other cow punchers. As to his name, Weston
would naturally have been astonished at perfect
strangers addressing him rightly where he believed
himself unknown.</p>

<p>Ross, eating his breakfast, and only half listening
to Hank, looked down at the prostrate man
speculatively, his mind full of suspicion, but not
so sure as on the previous day that there was no
flaw in his reasoning. He had not had an opportunity,
the day before, of speaking to Hank about
the matter, and now he decided to keep his suspicions
to himself for the present.</p>

<p>His suspicions, however, during the two weeks
which followed, were swallowed up in the anxiety
that attended this, the first "case" where he had
been obliged to assume all responsibility. The
care and interruptions to his rest wore on him.
Never had one of Aunt Anne&#8217;s hair mattresses invited
sleep as did the blankets laid on the dirt
floor when he found time to lie on them. Often
he fell asleep sitting on the hard bench, his head
on his arms crossed on the table, while Hank was
frying flapjacks and boiling thick black coffee.</p>

<p>As for the patient, he accepted Ross&#8217;s ministrations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
with but few remarks. As his thigh bone
began to knit, he became querulous, and finally
passively enduring.</p>

<p>"When you goin&#8217; to let me out of this?" he
asked on the day when Ross last measured the
injured leg.</p>

<p>The boy settled back on his heels. "I have
sent for some plaster of Paris," he explained, "and,
by the time it gets here, your leg will be healed
and ready for a cast. Then you can be taken back
to Cody and let the doctor there see you. If it was
not for that ugly fracture you would have been out
of here before. If you&#8217;d only have the Cody doctor
to look you over now<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>The man grunted, and worked restlessly at the
sand-bag, which, on the outside of his leg, reached
his armpit.</p>

<p>"Cody doctor be hanged!" he remarked unaffably.
"He don&#8217;t know half as much as you do."</p>

<p>It was the nearest approach to thanks or praise
he had given Ross.</p>

<p>"That Cody doctor ain&#8217;t worth shucks," confirmed
Hank, who occupied a box beside the stove.
"He tended a feller that I knew, and let &#8217;im die."
The speaker looked from Ross to his patient with
an expression which plainly said that the former
could not be guilty of any such charge.</p>

<p>The brown eyes of the patient rolled slowly in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
their sockets until their gaze could rest on Ross.
Then the lids dropped over them. "The Cody
doctor be hanged!" he remarked again more
affably, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ross continued to sit on his heels until his
patient commenced to snore. Then he glanced at
the occupant of the box seat and asked softly:</p>

<p>"Hank, has Weston ever told you where he
came from?"</p>

<p>"Nope," responded Hank absently. "Not where
he hails from ner where he&#8217;s started fer, ner why,
ner what fer. That&#8217;s nothin&#8217; though, Doc." Here
Hank looked sidewise at Ross. "You&#8217;ll find, if
ye stay in these parts long, that there&#8217;s lots of
men who ain&#8217;t partin&#8217; with every fact they know
within ten minutes after ye&#8217;re introduced to &#8217;em.
And you&#8217;ll find, too, that it ain&#8217;t always healthy to
ask questions. Ye have th&#8217; sort of sense who ye can
question and who ye can&#8217;t."</p>

<p>"And this fellow<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" Ross jerked his head
in the direction of the sleeper.</p>

<p>Hank yawned and reached for the poker and a
stick of wood. "I ain&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to inquire fer into
his history&#8211;unless I could inquire of some one
else besides himself, that is. Hello!" he interrupted
himself suddenly with the stick held over
the stove. "Who&#8217;s that hikin&#8217; over the Creek?"</p>

<p>Ross arose with alacrity and went to the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
The first snow had fallen on the bad lands, but in
an hour it had been whisked away by a warm
northwest wind, leaving the ground soft and a
little stream of water in Dry Creek across which
rode a man who proved to be a prospector from
the mountains.</p>

<p>"Must have had a bit of snow here," he called
as he turned his horse into the corral. "Up t&#8217;
Miners&#8217; Camp it&#8217;s two inches deep and driftin&#8217;."</p>

<p>As this prospector was eating his dinner, he
most unexpectedly gave Ross his first news of
Weimer. The boy, finding Hank both intelligent
and sympathetic, had talked freely concerning his
mission in the mountains and his desire to return
East at an early date. To the latter subject, in all
its details of study and college-attendance, Hank
listened and questioned in open interest. But,
when Ross touched the subject of Weimer and the
McKenzies, the other was non-committal and
guarded, as became a landlord who might be
called upon any day to serve flapjacks and coffee
to all of the parties under discussion.</p>

<p>"I hope," he had observed cautiously on two or
three occasions, "that you&#8217;ll get on all right with
Uncle Jake Weimer."</p>

<p>And, although his tone implied a doubt, Ross
could not prevail on him to explain it.</p>

<p>But the prospector, who had ridden through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
from the mountains, and knew nothing of Ross or
of his origin, spoke more freely. He had passed
along Meadow Creek but a few days before.</p>

<p>"Dutch Weimer," he told Hank as he bolted
boiled cabbage and flapjacks, "was settin&#8217; at the
door of his shack, a-smokin&#8217; as though his claims
was all patented and secure. He says that Eastern
pal of hisn is a-sendin&#8217; some one t&#8217; help &#8217;im out."</p>

<p>Hank coughed behind his hand, and motioned
toward Ross, busy with his patient; but at first the
prospector was too intent on his food to notice.</p>

<p>"And there," he observed with a chuckle, "are
them two McKenzie boys a-settin&#8217; on their claims
next door and waitin&#8217;." He gave another chuckle.
"Curious how that snow-blindness should have
touched Dutch Weimer."</p>

<p>Then he saw Hank&#8217;s restraining gesture, and
paused. Glancing down, he met Lon Weston&#8217;s
veiled brown eyes and Ross&#8217;s wide gray ones; but
the prospector had suddenly become as non-committal
as Hank himself, nor did Ross&#8217;s persistent
questioning wring from him any further details.
He had but passed that way, he assured Ross, had
stopped but a moment in front of Weimer&#8217;s cabin
and that was all.</p>

<p>But what he had said was enough to leave Ross
troubled, and impatient to start for Meadow Creek
and his delayed work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>Finally the plaster of Paris came. The stage
from Cody brought it one noon, and Ross&#8217;s spirits
arose at the prospect of release from his unwelcome
charge.</p>

<p>"If it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t fer yer Uncle Samuel&#8217;s long arm of
the law, Doc," the stage-driver informed him as
he was disposing of potatoes and pork, "I&#8217;d leave
my stage right here and see ye wind all them stiff
rags around that there leg. I&#8217;d like t&#8217; see th&#8217;
finish s&#8217; long as I seen the beginnin&#8217;. But the
trouble with bein&#8217; stage skinner is, ye&#8217;ve got t&#8217;
hike along no matter what shows ye come acrost
on the trail. Hand them spuds acrost, Doc, will
ye? Hank, if ye&#8217;d let &#8217;em smell fire a minute &#8217;r
two mebby I could drive my fork int&#8217; &#8217;em."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, he arose from the bench,
drew the back of his hand across his mouth and
addressed Weston. "Wall, I suppose you&#8217;ll be
ready t&#8217; be boosted onto the stage when I come
back in th&#8217; mornin&#8217;? S&#8217; long."</p>

<p>Scarcely had his four bronchos topped the hill
on the further side of Dry Creek before a procession,
the like of which Ross had never seen, appeared
on the trail the other side of the dugout.
It was a pack outfit on horses accompanied by a
man and a boy. It slowly rounded the shoulder
of the hill behind the corral. The man rode ahead
whistling gaily, his sombrero pulled low over his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
eyes, a purple tie knotted under the turn-over collar
of his flannel shirt. His horse&#8217;s tail was tied
to a rope which, in turn, was tied loosely about the
neck of the first pack animal. In similar fashion
the five bronchos were held together on the trail,
and after them came a horse ridden by a boy about
Ross&#8217;s height. On the pack animals were wooden
saddles piled high with supplies for a camp, boxes
and bags securely roped to the saddles.</p>

<p>Hank, in the act of clearing the dishes from the
bare board table, stopped with a platter of boiled
turnip and pork suspended in the air. "By the
great horn spoon!" he yelled, "if there don&#8217;t come
Wishin&#8217; Wilson! And a pack outfit! Is my eyes
a-foolin&#8217; me? Doc, look out. Is it a five bronc
outfit, or ain&#8217;t it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is," confirmed Ross.</p>

<p>He arose from his seat on the floor where he was
working in the plaster and stepped to the door.
But Hank was before him holding up the platter
of food.</p>

<p>"Hey, there, Wishin&#8217;! Here&#8217;s some come-backs
hot fer ye! Where&#8217;d ye come from? Where ye
goin&#8217; and what fer and how long and why and all
the rest?" Evidently the newcomer was one of
the kind that could safely be questioned, for Hank
turned himself into a great interrogation point as
he set the platter down, and rushing out, pulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
the stranger from his horse, shaking him in familiar
bear play.</p>

<p>Ross watched while the train filed slowly up to
the dugout, bringing the boy&#8217;s mount to rest in
front of the door.</p>

<p>The young rider wore a new brown corduroy
suit, and a long fur coat, the skirts of which were
drawn up awkwardly above a pair of high riding
boots and tucked under the rider&#8217;s legs. A pair of
shining silver spurs adorned the heels of the boots,
while a sealskin cap crowned a head covered with
closely cropped hair darker than Ross&#8217;s. His eyes
also were darker and his figure, although of the
same height, was more slender than Ross&#8217;s. He was
also, apparently, a couple of years younger.</p>

<p>The two boys nodded at each other, Ross with
awkward cordiality and interest, the stranger
carelessly and with unmistakable condescension.
Swinging himself out of the saddle he said pleasantly
but commandingly:</p>

<p>"Take my coat inside, please."</p>

<p>He shed his fur coat and pulled off his fur-lined
gloves and tossed both into Ross&#8217;s arms, while
Hank, watching the proceeding out of the tail of
an amused eye, talked with Wilson.</p>

<p>Ross, biting his lips, backed into the shack and
tossed coat and gloves on the end of the table near
Weston. The boy, following his moves from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
doorway, pointed at the prostrate man, asking in
a surprised and subdued voice:</p>

<p>"What ails him?"</p>

<p>"Broke his leg," responded Ross shortly, not
relishing the touch of lordliness in the other&#8217;s
manner.</p>

<p>"How did he do it?" demanded the stranger.</p>

<p>"Horse fell on him," answered Ross, and returned
abruptly to his work with the plaster.</p>

<p>Weston lay with his blanket drawn up to his
chin and one arm thrown over his face and ear,
his face turned to the wall. He was breathing
regularly as though in sleep, although Ross knew
he was wide awake. This was a favorite position
with him when Hank was entertaining guests. It
saved him the trouble of responding to inquiries,
and, as Ross had come to suspect, might also serve
to avert a chance recognition.</p>

<p>Presently Wilson approached the dugout, leaving
the boy in the corral rubbing down his mount.
One arm was thrown in rough affection over Hank&#8217;s
shoulder while the two pulled each other about like
two boys at play.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Hank!" Wilson exclaimed at the
door, "this is what ye might call God&#8217;s country,
and I always have a feelin&#8217; of gettin&#8217; home in these
parts. But, Jehoshaphat! it didn&#8217;t look a spell
ago as if I&#8217;d ever strike the trail to the mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
again. It looked like as if I&#8217;d have to throw up
my claims and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Sh!" interrupted Hank tiptoeing into the
shack. "Guess he&#8217;s asleep, ain&#8217;t he?" He explained
over his shoulder in a hoarse whisper.
"Chap named Weston that come this way three
weeks ago and bust his leg out in front, here.
Hoss fell on him."</p>

<p>Wilson, who followed at Hank&#8217;s heels, looked
Weston over with friendly but detached interest.
"On the mend, is he?" asked the newcomer subduing
his voice with difficulty.</p>

<p>Hank forgot to continue his whisper. "You
bet!" he exclaimed heartily. "Doc here is
a-mendin&#8217; him t&#8217; beat anything I ever seen from a
full sized doctor." He jerked his thumb toward
Ross. "Doc&#8217;s goin&#8217; to have him all plastered up
and out of here to-morrow."</p>

<p>Wishing looked at Ross with a pleasant nod,
stepped over the bench and was about to seat himself
at the table when he bethought him suddenly
of his riding companion. Leaning forward he
looked out of the doorway. Then with a nod he
sat down and forgetting that Weston was supposedly
sleeping, raised his voice again to its
normal high key.</p>

<p>"Fetch on them come-backs, Hank. My pard&#8217;ll
be here in a minute. I need t&#8217; git the start of him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
in eating always, fer he ain&#8217;t long on grub such as
we shake out here. I expect," with an amused
chuckle, "that it ain&#8217;t exactly what he&#8217;s used to."</p>

<p>Hank slapped his knee and leaned forward.
"Say, Wishin&#8217;, how d&#8217;ye come t&#8217; be hikin&#8217; over
the country with Queen Victory&#8217;s youngest? My
eyes! Ain&#8217;t he a reg&#8217;lar ornament t&#8217; th&#8217; landscape?"</p>

<p>Wishing Wilson laughed softly and then glancing
hastily from Ross to Weston, shook his head
at Hank. "Less is all right!" he declared cautiously.
"He&#8217;s young yet. Lots of time to learn&#8211;more
time &#8217;n you and me have, Hank."</p>

<p>Hank set coffee before his guest, asking, "Who
is he and where does he hail from?"</p>

<p>Wilson squared himself before the table, both
arms resting thereon and began to eat noisily, talking
between knifefuls.</p>

<p>"Luckiest thing for me that ever struck the
trail, that young feller is," he began. "I was
stranded down in Omaha without a red cent in
my pocket and no way of raisin&#8217; one. If you&#8217;ll
believe me I couldn&#8217;t find a man in Omaha with
brains enough to believe in them claims of mine,
no, not with the ore assay report before their eyes.
I tell ye, Hank, times have changed down in
Omaha. There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no grub-stakers waitin&#8217;
around like there used to be fer prospectors to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
snatch up&#8211;no, not one. And just as I was gettin&#8217;
plum used up talkin&#8217;, this young feller, Less
Jones, fell onto me outer a clear sky. It was in a
hotel where I went t&#8217; talk with a drummer, but
not t&#8217; eat. Why, Hank, yer Uncle Wilson didn&#8217;t
have the price of a hotel dinner handy, and that
drummer never treated me! Well, I stood tryin&#8217;
to persuade him that his salary was burning fer
investment in my claims, when in comes Less and
lined up &#8217;longside me listenin&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t any
kind of objection to his hearin&#8217;, but he looked like
such a cub that I never paid no attention t&#8217; &#8217;im,
but when the drummer said a final &#8217;Nix,&#8217; Less he
stepped up and asked me about the claims, and, t&#8217;
make a long story short, before the end of the day
I was hikin&#8217; over town hot footed on the trail of
supplies with Less at my heels with an open
pocketbook."</p>

<p>"Does he stay up t&#8217; the Creek with you?" asked
Hank wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Says he will," laughed Wilson. "Says he&#8217;s
wanted for years t&#8217; try his luck with quartz!"</p>

<p>"Must &#8217;a&#8217; begun wantin&#8217; then when he was a
baby," remarked Hank succinctly. "Where&#8217;s his
ma and pa?"</p>

<p>Wishing shrugged his shoulders and balanced a
quantity of pork and potatoes on the blade of his
knife. "Search me! He says there&#8217;s no one to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
hender him doin&#8217; what he pleases, and so I take it
he&#8217;s dropped out of some fairy orphanage som&#8217;ers
where they have gold t&#8217; burn. I&#8217;m fallin&#8217; on his
neck more&#8217;n I&#8217;m askin&#8217; him questions that he don&#8217;t
want t&#8217; answer. Less is an all right sort, you&#8217;ll
find, but he ain&#8217;t long on information."</p>

<p>At this point Wishing&#8217;s garrulity suffered an interruption
from the entrance of his young partner.</p>

<p>Leslie Jones walked with the erect bearing that
Aunt Anne coveted for Ross. Buttoning his short
corduroy jacket over a soft flannel shirt, across the
front of which was suspended a large gold chain,
he ran his fingers around inside his collar and
looked about impatiently.</p>

<p>Ross, attending strictly to his work, did not
look up. Hank, sitting on a bench opposite
Wilson, spread his elbows yet further apart on the
table and indicated a place beside him.</p>

<p>"Set down and fall to, young feller!"</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ll wash up first," returned Leslie in a tone
which had a decided edge. His manner plainly
indicated his desire to be waited on.</p>

<p>Hank raised his eyebrows and waved a hand
vaguely toward the stove. "There&#8217;s pans &#8217;n&#8217;
water. Help yerself. Guess there&#8217;s a towel hikin&#8217;
about som&#8217;ers in the corner. My dozen best handmade
&#8217;uns ain&#8217;t come in yet from the laundry!"</p>

<p>Every one laughed except Weston and Leslie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
The former breathed regularly, apparently unconscious
of all that was said and done in the room.
The latter flushed, and plunging into the corner
tumbled the pans about angrily like a spoiled
child, spilling as much water on the floor as he
could. Then he sat down beside his partner and
asked shortly for some hot coffee, with an emphasis
on the adjective.</p>

<p>Hank leisurely pushed the coffee-pot across the
table. "Help yerself. This was hot a spell ago
and will be again at supper time." Hank&#8217;s voice
having acquired an edge by this time, "Victory&#8217;s
youngest" poured the coffee angrily but wordlessly
into his thick cup and ate in silence, listening to
Wilson, who was too much occupied with a vision
of riches to come to allow such scenes to disturb
his equanimity.</p>

<p>"As I told Less," he went on, raising his voice
to drown opposition, "we&#8217;ll leave part of the sticks
and the grub up the cañon to the coal claims and
then when it comes winter and the mountains are
impassable, we&#8217;ll just strike the trail over from the
Creek to the cañon and work the coal till things
open up in the spring. That Creek is a mean place
to drop into this late."</p>

<p>"What Creek?" asked Ross, suddenly awakening
to the conversation.</p>

<p>"Meadow Creek," returned Wishing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>"That&#8217;s where Doc is bound fer, Wishing&#8217;,"
volunteered Hank. "Doc is come out t&#8217; help
Jake Weimer."</p>

<p>Wishing surveyed the boy with cordial eyes.
"Jake Weimer, hey? We&#8217;ll be neighbors, then.
My claims ain&#8217;t two miles up the Creek."</p>

<p>"Doc, he&#8217;s Grant&#8217;s boy," supplemented Hank.
"But I bet my last year&#8217;s hat that he can&#8217;t mine
it as well as he can doctor."</p>

<p>"Doctor!" exclaimed Leslie Jones curiously.
"Are you a doctor?"</p>

<p>"He&#8217;s fixed him up all right," interrupted Hank
pointing to Weston. "Stretched his leg over my
best chicken-coop and needled his arm and made
&#8217;im walk a chalk line generally. Oh, I tell ye
Doc is better than the Cody doctor."</p>

<p>Ross laughed. "I know something about medicine
and surgery," he confessed. "I&#8217;ve read and
helped my uncle, Dr. Grant. That&#8217;s all."</p>

<p>"All!" echoed Leslie Jones. His manner was
touched with disbelief as he looked from Weston
to Ross. "And did you, alone, set a leg?"</p>

<p>Ross sought to change the subject. "Aw&#8211;that&#8217;s
not much&#8211;when you know how. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m
to have neighbors up on Meadow Creek. Hope I
don&#8217;t have to stay there any longer than you do."</p>

<p>"Expect to clean up the title this year, do you?"
asked Wilson.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>"That&#8217;s what I came for."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say now is that you&#8217;ll be mighty
glad you come. I tell ye what, Doc, Meadow Creek
is the mining deestrict of the future," whereupon
Wishing launched on a glowing account of the
future of Meadow Creek claims as he saw the
future. His eyes lighted up and he forgot to eat
as he told of the wonderful value of the gold and
silver that he expected to pull out of the claims he
had staked the previous year. He believed so
thoroughly in his own vision that even Ross,
whose interests were far removed from gold mining,
felt a thrill of expectancy as to the outcome
of his work in Meadow Creek, while Leslie, whose
appetite was slight for the coarse, ill-cooked food,
dropped his fork to listen although he must have
heard the recital many times before.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner, the two saddled up and
departed in the order in which they had come.</p>

<p>"So long!" yelled Wilson, waving his hat.
"We expect t&#8217; strike it rich before a month."</p>

<p>"Good luck!" shouted Hank and Ross together,
the latter adding, "I&#8217;ll see you again in a few days."</p>

<p>Hank, stuffing his hands into his pockets, pursed
up his lips and whistled shortly as the pack outfit
disappeared in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"If Wishin&#8217; is cal&#8217;latin&#8217; that he has enough
there to last two men all winter he&#8217;s about as far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
off in his cal&#8217;lations as&#8211;well, as Wishin&#8217; usually
is. Wishin&#8217; ain&#8217;t no lightnin&#8217; cal&#8217;later on any
subject, but he&#8217;s a mighty likely chap t&#8217; have
around."</p>

<p>"Judging from the small amount his pard ate
to-day he has food enough, I should say," returned
Ross, adding hastily, "but then I realize that I
know nothing about it."</p>

<p>"Huh!" laughed Hank, "he must know that
when that there young chap has been in the
mountings a few days he&#8217;ll eat mulligan &#8217;n&#8217;
spotted pup &#8217;n&#8217; bacon with the best of &#8217;em. His
will be a good, lively comin&#8217; appetite&#8211;but huh!
I should hate mightily t&#8217; have t&#8217; feed &#8217;im. Wonder
if Wishin&#8217; has packed some bibs along &#8217;n&#8217; silk
socks &#8217;n&#8217; hand-warmers! Huh!"</p>

<p>When Ross reëntered the cabin he found Weston
staring out of the doorway, his arm stretched by
his side.</p>

<p>"Guess you didn&#8217;t sleep much," remarked Hank
noisily gathering up the dishes.</p>

<p>"All I wanted to," returned Weston shortly.</p>

<p>Hank piled the dishes into a pan and poured
boiling water over them. "M-m," he soliloquized,
"all the time I was lookin&#8217; at him I was thinkin&#8217;
I&#8217;d seen that young Jones before. M-m&#8211;where, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>No one answered, and he washed dishes in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
silence while Ross returned to his work and
Weston lay staring out-of-doors.</p>

<p>The following day Ross saw his patient depart
on the stage headed toward Cody, and prepared
to take the next one himself in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>When he assisted Weston out of the door of the
dugout, he knew exactly as much about him as
when he followed his prostrate figure in at the
same door three weeks before&#8211;and no more,
unless the name be excepted.</p>

<p>Hank watched the stage off with a scowl, and
then departed from his usual custom of cautious
speech, where possible customers were concerned.</p>

<p>"Guess that feller must &#8217;a&#8217; hailed from som&#8217;ers
beside Wyoming," he grumbled. "Now, a Wyoming
chap would &#8217;a&#8217; paid his bill, or if he was on
the hog&#8217;s back, he&#8217;d owned up and passed his
promise. But that there maverick never even
said, &#8217;Thank ye,&#8217; to you or me; and here you&#8217;re
knocked out of three weeks&#8217; work along of him,
to say nothin&#8217; of the work day and night you&#8217;ve
put in on &#8217;im. Well, good riddance; &#8217;tain&#8217;t no

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>A MAN WHO NEEDED BRACING UP</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> road to Miners&#8217; Camp from Meeteetse, forty-five
miles long, follows the Grey Bull to its junction
with Wood River. Thence it wanders along
through miles of fertile ranch lands; then, rising
among the black foot-hills, up, up, it winds across
the precipitous face of Jo-Jo Hill, and plunges
among the snow-crowned Shoshones, crowded
nearer and yet nearer to Wood River until finally
there is but room for the narrow track and the
narrow stream at the bottom of the deep cañon.</p>

<p>This was the road which Ross traveled the
day following Weston&#8217;s departure for Cody, and
traveled in increasing discomfort. The further
they advanced among the mountains, the colder it
became, until, finally, Ross was obliged to desert
the high seat beside Bill Travers, the driver, and
seek shelter inside the stage, but not until he
had learned from Bill that there was no hotel in
Miners&#8217; Camp.</p>

<p>In talking with Hank he had taken it for
granted that there was a lodging house of some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
description and so had asked no questions on the
subject.</p>

<p>"I pack my grub along," Bill assured him carelessly,
"&#8217;n&#8217; roll up in a bunk in a shack that some
one &#8217;r other has left. If you&#8217;ve packed yer bed
along, stay with me to-night. There&#8217;s the floor,"
hospitably, "and I guess I can rustle grub enough
fer both. Anyhow, there&#8217;s two eatin&#8217;-houses where
you could fill up."</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon the stage crawled
through the dusk over a yielding bridge built
of hemlock saplings creaking under their coating
of ice and snow, and stopped in front of a shack
out of whose open door glinted a welcome light.
Another light appeared high up on the side of the
mountain.</p>

<p>"Hold up there, Bill," was the shout which had
brought the stage to a standstill. "Got a cold,
hungry young chap inside there, name of Grant?
Wishin&#8217; Wilson went through yesterday and said
he&#8217;d be along with you to-day."</p>

<p>Ross recognized the voice as belonging to Steele,
and, opening the stage door, answered for himself
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Steele shook hands cordially. "Better get out
here, Grant," he invited in an offhand way; "I
have some beefsteak ready to fry, and the spuds
are bakin&#8217; in the oven."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>Ross climbed out with as much alacrity as
his cold, benumbed limbs would permit. But no
sooner was he on the ground than something
queer occurred. His legs gave every indication
of doubling up under him, while his head felt
as large and airy as a balloon. He clutched the
wheel, but not until Steele had clutched him.</p>

<p>"Altitude!" exclaimed Steele. "Being a mile
and a half above sea-level don&#8217;t agree with most
people just at first."</p>

<p>Ross leaned against the wheel, looking up giddily
at the strip of sky corralled between the
towering summits of Dundee and Gale&#8217;s Ridge. It
seemed to him that it was the mountains and not
the altitude which oppressed him, and bore down
upon him, and shut off his breath.</p>

<p>"My baggage," he began hesitatingly to the
stage-driver, "where&#8211;if there&#8217;s no hotel<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>But Steele interposed. "Lend a hand here,
Bill, with these trunks. I want Grant to put up
at my hotel to-night, bag and baggage."</p>

<p>Bill grinned, and laid hands on the emergency
chest. "He&#8217;ll git a better layout than at my old
shack, I tell ye! Say! Is Uncle Jake in Camp?"</p>

<p>Steele shook his head. "Nope. I&#8217;m going to
see about packin&#8217; Grant over to the Creek myself
in a few days," and a great wave of thankfulness
surged over Ross.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>A few moments later Steele waved his hand
around the one room of his little log shack.
"This is the only kind of home you&#8217;ll find up
here, Grant, about the same as Weimer has over on
the Creek. Things are rough and ready here,
without any frills."</p>

<p>As he spoke he glanced at the larger of Ross&#8217;s
trunks.</p>

<p>If Amos Steele understood one subject better
than mining operations, that one subject was men.
He saw in Ross an overgrown, homesick boy, with
a stout but untested "backbone."</p>

<p>"And I wonder," thought Steele, "how far that
backbone is going to take him when it gets a
healthy development, and&#8211;how far is he goin&#8217; to
develop it?"</p>

<p>Furthermore, Steele concluded, Ross was more
accustomed to bending over a book than over a
shovel; and he shrugged his shoulders at the
thought of the Weimer-Grant claims.</p>

<p>"His backbone can&#8217;t do everything," he decided,
"no matter how stout it grows, especially
when Weimer has lost his."</p>

<p>Steele&#8217;s shack was at the foot of Gale&#8217;s Ridge.
Half-way up the mountainside was another and
larger shack, where his miners, thirty in number,
ate. Above that was the "bunk-house" where
they slept. And yet higher up was the mouth of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
the tunnel out of which the Gale&#8217;s Ridge Mining
Company expected to pull vast wealth when the
Burlington Road had done its part.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;d rather bach it," Steele explained to Ross as
they sat down to beefsteak and baked potatoes,
"than to be with the men. It&#8217;s pleasanter for me&#8211;and,"
with a jolly laugh, "for them also, I expect."</p>

<p>Ross liked this frank young superintendent who
had so kindly taken him in. He felt that he
must get his bearings in some way, and Steele was
the man to set him right.</p>

<p>Therefore quite early in the evening the boy
burst out with:</p>

<p>"Mr. Steele, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that
I&#8217;m the greenest tenderfoot that ever came to
Wyoming. Now, you know the ropes here, and
I don&#8217;t. Will you advise me?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I&#8217;ve been wanting to do,"
assented Steele swiftly and heartily. "But I
won&#8217;t do it at all to-night. It&#8217;ll take you a few
days to get over your light-headedness, and until
you do the trail around Crosby won&#8217;t be healthy
ridin&#8217; for you. Anyway, there&#8217;s a lot to be done,
for Uncle Jake Weimer hasn&#8217;t laid in any winter
supplies yet."</p>

<p>Ross tipped his chair back against the unhewn
logs, and thrust his hands into his pockets. Ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
since the talkative prospector had passed through
the stage camp he had wondered what manner of
man Weimer was. But not until he was jolting
along in the stage that day did one sentence especially
recur to him in all its possible significance.</p>

<p>The prospector had said, "&#8217;Curious how that
snow-blindness should have touched Dutch Weimer.&#8217;"</p>

<p>Therefore, Ross&#8217;s first question was of the man
he had crossed the continent to help.</p>

<p>The answer reached far into the night; and when
at last Ross, wrapped in his blankets, lay down in
a bunk built against the wall, it was a long time
before sleep came, tired as he was.</p>

<p>The following evening, after a full day&#8217;s work,
he sat down beside the little home-made table to
write to Dr. Grant and Aunt Anne while Steele
washed up the supper dishes.</p>

<p>"I should be worse than helpless, were it not
for Steele," he wrote; "and even with him to help
me I may as well own up I am in blue funk. Not
a man is there to hire; so the programme for the
next few months seems to be this: Yours truly
has got to put on some muscle, and buckle down
to pick and shovel. Where do you think Piersol&#8217;s
&#8217;Histology&#8217; is coming in, uncle, or that man
Remsen?</p>

<p>"But that&#8217;s not the worst. It seems that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
Weimer isn&#8217;t as stout in his head as he was before he
was stricken with snow-blindness, and, although
he is as stout as ever in his muscles, he doesn&#8217;t
take kindly to work any more. Hasn&#8217;t even taken
the winter&#8217;s supplies of food and dynamite over to
Meadow Creek. He&#8217;s just smoking his pipe in
peace because of the man father is sending to help
him out! But I can tell you that the peace is all
on his side.</p>

<p>"The mountains here are the original packages,
all right. They&#8217;re miles high, and look as if
they&#8217;d topple over on a fellow with but half an
excuse. And then the air&#8211;or the lack of it,
rather! I&#8217;ve not been able to walk any distance
without a cane, so uncertain does this rare air
make me in my motions. But Steele says I&#8217;ll get
over that in a day or two. So, day after to-morrow
he is going with me to Meadow Creek with
the Gale&#8217;s Ridge Company&#8217;s horses&#8211;we &#8217;pack&#8217;
over the supplies for the winter, and the emergency
chest just as it is; but, Aunt Anne, only a small
portion of the contents of my big trunk can go.
Over on the Creek Steele can explain to me about
the amount of work to be done, for fear Weimer
doesn&#8217;t tell it straight<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Suddenly Ross stopped. He leaned back and
bit his pencil, his eyes narrowing frowningly as
he glanced over the letter. Then with a gesture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
of disdain he caught up the sheets, and tore them
into fragments.</p>

<p>Steele paused in the act of placing the dishes in
the rough cupboard which was nailed to the logs
behind the stove.</p>

<p>"Well, I&#8217;d think twice before I tore up a letter&#8211;too
hard work to write &#8217;em."</p>

<p>"I have thought twice," returned Ross emphatically.
"That&#8217;s why I tore it up. No use piling
up all my difficulties on them first thing. Aunt
Anne worries enough over my being here, as it is."</p>

<p>"So there&#8217;s an &#8217;Aunt Anne,&#8217; is there?" mused
Steele to himself over the dishes. He glanced at
the bits of paper in a heap on the table. "Good
work she and that doctor uncle have done." He
surveyed Ross&#8217;s clean-cut, clear-eyed face as it bent
above a second and brighter letter, one that ignored
or made light of the difficulties oppressing
the boy.</p>

<p>In order to divert further the attention of the
recipients, Ross also wrote divers pieces of information
that he had learned from Steele.</p>

<p>"I am trying to ferret out this gold mining business
from the beginning," he wrote. "I never got
the hang of it before, and, if Mr. Steele wasn&#8217;t
everlasting patient with me, I wouldn&#8217;t be getting
much now, because everything is so new and
strange here. I don&#8217;t half understand the men&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
lingo, because they have a strange name for everything....
Well, it seems that a gold mine
up here is started in some such a way as this: along
comes a prospector&#8211;quartz crazy, he is called if
he&#8217;s in dead earnest&#8211;with a pick and shovel, a
hammer and microscope, and a camp outfit. If
some one else has provided him with food and the
outfit he is &#8217;grub-staked&#8217; and his &#8217;pard&#8217; is entitled
to half of the results of his work. Father, for
instance, has grub-staked Weimer for years. This
prospector pegs away at the rocks, getting specimens
of ore and examining them under his microscope.
He goes right past rocks that look to me
full of gold they glitter so. No gold in such!
But when he finds some common, dull old stone
that doesn&#8217;t show up much to me but has all the
earmarks of &#8217;a high value&#8217; in gold, then he thinks
he has found the outcropping of a good &#8217;lead,&#8217;
because all the rock that is behind that rock in
the same strata is supposed to have that much gold
in it or more. So there he &#8217;stakes his claim.&#8217;
You see I&#8217;ve got the hang of a few of the terms
already. First, he drives a stake near the rock
and leaves on it a paper with his name and the date
and a notice that the land is his for so many feet
each way. He can&#8217;t take possession of more than
six hundred feet one way and fifteen hundred the
other in one claim, but he can stake off as many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
other claims right beside this first as he wants to.
The staking is easy enough, but the tug of war
comes in doing enough work to patent the claims!
This means to get a deed of possession from the
state. There is where Weimer and I are up against
it&#8211;on the work side! But guess I&#8217;d better not
make your heads ache any more with such an
accumulation of learned facts. I&#8217;ll just say good-bye
now and continue the headache in my
next."</p>

<p>To his father he wrote a different kind of letter,
a defense of his delay at Dry Creek.</p>

<p>"I couldn&#8217;t desert a man in that shape," he
wrote, "although I have lost three weeks at exactly
the season of the year, I find, when three
weeks count for the most. I&#8217;m sorry it happened
that way, but I shall try to put in good time now
and make up. Anyway, I guess the delay is as
broad as it is long, because, if that accident hadn&#8217;t
occurred, I shouldn&#8217;t have known Steele; and it&#8217;s
his help that&#8217;s smoothing things out here for me
to begin work."</p>

<p>Ross did not know that the way he had conducted
himself at Dry Creek was the cause of the
very practical interest which Steele was taking in
him.</p>

<p>But not all of Steele&#8217;s influence in Camp had secured
a single laborer for Meadow Creek. Ross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
found that Andy&#8217;s explanation on the Cody stage
held good. No one cared to go any further out of
the world than Miners&#8217; Camp.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s bad enough," one of the Mountain Company&#8217;s
men told Ross, "up here eighty miles from
the railroad, with a stage only three times a week
in summer and any time it can get through in the
winter. But, when it comes to workin&#8217; on the
Creek, <i>ex</i>cuse me! Seven mile over Crosby, and
the trail shut up half the year. No, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
Cody when the Mountain works shuts down."</p>

<p>The Gale&#8217;s Ridge Company worked all winter;
but the Mountain Company dismissed its employees,
twenty in number, when the deep snows
came.</p>

<p>To the twenty Ross applied in vain. Labor was
dear and men scarce "Cody way," and the miners
refused to be mewed up over on the Creek for five
months at any price.</p>

<p>"You see," Steele explained, "I&#8217;d be glad to employ
all the twenty during the winter myself; but
not many of &#8217;em will ever stay up here in Camp&#8211;too
much cut off. I shall run short of hands all
winter. Of course, when the railroad gets up here,
it will be different. They&#8217;ll be willing to stay
then."</p>

<p>Ross checked a groan. "The railroad isn&#8217;t here,
but I am," he observed grimly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>Steele looked at him curiously. "Why don&#8217;t
you strike the trail back East," he asked abruptly,
"since you started out without understanding the
situation?"</p>

<p>Ross glanced up in surprise. "Why, I never
thought of doing that!" he exclaimed, and dropped
the subject.</p>

<p>But Steele continued to look him over with a
new interest; for the stage the previous evening
had brought to Steele a letter from the elder Grant
asking for private information concerning the situation
Ross, Junior, was encountering. Ross&#8217;s brief
letters from Dry Creek had shown Ross, Senior,
that he had no real knowledge of the nature of the
difficulties into which he had sent his son.</p>

<p>The morning of the third day, Ross, staggering
around uncertainly without a cane, aided Steele in
binding the supplies on the wooden saddles of the
packhorses. From the Gale&#8217;s Ridge Company&#8217;s
supply-shack they brought sacks of flour and cornmeal,
boxes of canned vegetables and condensed
milk, sides of bacon and hams, bags of coffee and
tea, all of which Steele with many a twist of the
rope and "half-hitch" secured to the clumsy saddles.
The trustiest horse carried the emergency
chest. On Ross&#8217;s own horse, lashed behind his
saddle, were his bed blankets and a bundle from
the trunk Aunt Anne had packed with such care.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>"All ready?" called Steele, one foot in his
stirrup.</p>

<p>He looked back at Ross already mounted, bringing
up the rear of the string of packhorses, standing
in front of the company&#8217;s store.</p>

<p>"All ready," shouted Ross.</p>

<p>Steele, about to swing himself up, hesitated. He
glanced again at Ross. Then, dropping his bridle
reins to the ground, he disappeared inside the
store, emerging presently with a short rifle and a
cartridge belt.</p>

<p>"Ever use a gun?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ross hesitated. "I&#8217;ve practiced target shooting
a little, and gone hunting a few times; but," candidly,
"I don&#8217;t amount to shucks with a gun."</p>

<p>Steele grinned, and handed it up. "Take it
along," he advised, "and practice some more. It
may bring you fresh meat. Sometimes elk and
mountain sheep come down to the Creek to drink
over there&#8211;won&#8217;t come amiss, anyhow."</p>

<p>Ross accepted the gun; and Steele, going back
to the head of the procession, mounted, and led
the way up the cañon, which presently broadened
until it formed a snow-flecked valley a few rods
wide. Here were a dozen shacks, another eating
house, and the store of the Mountain Company.
The mouth of its tunnel could be seen high on the
side of the mountain above the store.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>Immediately beyond this valley the cañon was
nearly closed by two great peaks. The one on the
left was still Dundee; but on the right Gale&#8217;s Ridge
gave place to Crosby, behind which lay Meadow
Creek Valley.</p>

<p>Zigzagging across the face of this mountain
wound a narrow trail gradually ascending. Up
and yet up climbed the horses until Ross clung
to his saddle involuntarily while looking down.
Soon Wood River became a thread, and the
shacks became black doll-houses set in patches
of snow.</p>

<p>On the trail the snow lay deep in the hollows,
but was swept away wherever the east wind could
touch it. But, snow-filled or black, the trail ever
ascended. The peak of Dundee opposite, which
had seemed from the cañon narrow and remote,
stretched out now immense and so near that Ross
felt he could hurl a stone across and hit it.</p>

<p>He looked ahead. They were approaching the
dizzy shoulder of Crosby. Steele rounded it, and
disappeared. One by one the slow packhorses,
their loads hitting against the rocks on the inside
of the trail, crawled cautiously after, and also disappeared.
Then before Ross opened a view of
startling grandeur. He was looking out over the
top of Gale&#8217;s Ridge and down across Big Horn
Basin, beyond Cody, eighty miles away and into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
the blue heart of the Big Horn Mountains. The
sight brought with it a pang of homesickness.
Eighty miles from a railroad! Eighty difficult,
laborious miles! Ross felt helpless and small and
decidedly shaky in this strange new world about
which he had so much to learn.</p>

<p>Clinching his teeth hard together, he looked up.
Above were bowlders seemingly glued to the almost
upright mountainside. Below&#8211;but Ross&#8217;s
head swam, and he turned his eyes to the inside
of the trail, and clung to the saddle. Below was
a sheer drop of a thousand feet down to the falls
of Meadow Creek, which separated Crosby from
Gale&#8217;s Ridge. The mist came up in clouds rolling
thick and frosty in the zero air. This was the
quarter-mile of trail which cut Meadow Creek Valley
off from Wood River Cañon for months during
the year.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Steele as they stopped where
the trail widened beyond the dangerous shoulder,
"you didn&#8217;t take a header, did you?"</p>

<p>Ross passed his hand across his forehead. His
face was pale. "No, but&#8211;I felt every minute that
I&#8217;d go over."</p>

<p>"You&#8217;ll get used to that," returned Steele easily.
"You see why that trail becomes impassable later,
don&#8217;t you? If it was just the snow on the trail,
why, that wouldn&#8217;t count. You could shovel it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
off around the shoulder, and go on snow-shoes the
rest of the way. But, when the snow lodges up
over the shoulder something like ten feet deep,
and a chinook or warm wind comes along and
loosens it, a footfall or a man calling might start
it, and then<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" Steele shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"And there is no other way you can get into
the Creek valley?" asked Ross.</p>

<p>"No other way with a horse. You can follow
the Creek toward its source, they say, a few miles
and then across. Hunters go that way sometimes,
but on foot; and they have to scramble
for it."</p>

<p>On and on they went over a wide trail now beside
the clear little Meadow Creek. Ross began to
feel giddy again.</p>

<p>"Of course you do," Steele explained the next
time they made a stop, "because the Creek is half
a mile higher than the cañon. But you get over
that in a few days."</p>

<p>"I wonder," exclaimed Ross suddenly, "how
Leslie Jones stood that trail?"</p>

<p>"About the same as the average and ordinary
mortal," rejoined Steele sarcastically. "But you&#8217;ll
probably have a good many chances of finding out
for yourself. You&#8217;ll be glad to see anybody, even
young Jones!"</p>

<p>At last, after threading their way between spurs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
and over bowlders and through valleys, they
emerged on the other side of Crosby, and found
themselves in a bowl the sides of which were
formed by mountains so high and grim that Ross
gasped for the breath that he felt the peaks would
eventually shut off.</p>

<p>It was a queer and uncomfortable feeling, this
which the mountains gave him, a sense of being
shut in and overpowered and helpless.</p>

<p>The peaks on all sides were snow-heaped; but
the valley, protected as it was, showed patches of
black earth. Sage-brush with scrub spruce and
hemlock were the only vegetation of the valley
visible, but the sides of the mountains showed a
good growth of hemlock and pine trees reaching
to timber line only a few hundred feet up.</p>

<p>On the left at the foot of Crosby&#8211;whose back
looked as high to Ross as its face, despite the fact
that he was half a mile higher here than in the
cañon&#8211;two columns of smoke were ascending
from two clusters of hemlocks a quarter of a
mile apart. Toward these, Steele, drawing in his
horse, pointed.</p>

<p>"The first is your layout," he called back over
his shoulder, "the other is the McKenzies&#8217;!"</p>

<p>"And where is Wilson&#8217;s?" asked Ross, eagerly.</p>

<p>Steele faced in the opposite direction and indicated
a narrow trail that led to the right,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
disappearing in a forest of scrub pine which filled the
ravine between two of the mountains that formed
the rim of the bowl. "Follow that trail and
you&#8217;ll reach &#8217;em. But ten to one, before you can
do it they&#8217;ll follow the trail this way and reach
you!"</p>

<p>"I hope so!" exclaimed Ross in a heartfelt
tone.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was face to face with
Weimer.</p>

<p>The latter stood in the doorway of a low log
shack, his great hands cupped over large blue
goggles through which his eyes showed dimly,
the lids screwed together, leaving only slits for
the admission of the dreaded glare of light from
the snow. His hands were crusted with dirt. His
face, bearded to the rim of the goggles, was grimy,
and the beard matted. His hair hung uneven and
uncombed to his thick rounded shoulders. He
wore a colored flannel shirt, a sheepskin coat, and
corduroy trousers thrust into the knee-high tops
of old shoes.</p>

<p>In response to Steele&#8217;s greeting and introduction
Weimer extended his hand, peered at Ross a moment,
and then asked eagerly in a throaty, husky
voice of Steele:</p>

<p>"D&#8217;ye pack any tobac&#8217; over?"</p>

<p>"Lots of it," cried Steele jovially. "Enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
for your use and some for you to give to your
neighbors."</p>

<p>Immediately Weimer&#8217;s sagging, middle-aged figure
became straight and stiff, and his high forehead
wrinkled in a heavy frown.</p>

<p>"Give dem McKenzies anyting! Ven I do, it&#8217;ll
be ven my name ain&#8217;t Shake Veimer."</p>

<p>Steele stepped quickly in front of the older man,
and spoke forcefully. "There&#8217;s one thing, Uncle
Jake, that you&#8217;re givin&#8217; &#8217;em as fast as you can,
and that&#8217;s these claims."</p>

<p>"Nein! Nein!" Weimer shouted. "Das ist
nicht so!"</p>

<p>His uneven black hair bobbed wildly about his
shoulders. He pumped his powerful arms up and
down as if the McKenzies were beneath them.</p>

<p>Steele thrust his face near that of the agitated
man, and demanded roughly, "How many shots
have you put since you were over to Camp to get
me to write to young Grant&#8217;s father? Say, now!"</p>

<p>Weimer&#8217;s manner became cringing. He backed
into the cabin. "If your eyes<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" he began,
but Steele cut him short.</p>

<p>"You know you&#8217;ve not taken one pound of ore
out of your tunnel since. You know you have sat
around here waitin&#8217; for Grant to send some one to
help you out<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Weimer put up a great hand, and shrank back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
as a child would have retreated before his mother&#8217;s
upraised slipper. Steele followed him into the
cabin, and Ross slowly followed Steele.</p>

<p>"The snow ist come," whimpered Weimer;
"und I can&#8217;t see ven the snow comes, und the
tunnel so far ist to valk<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>But Steele cut short his complaints sternly.
"Now," he declared, "all your excuses must come
to an end. Here is some one to help. Young
Grant here is going to put this work through, and
you&#8217;ve got to brace up and help him. I should be
ashamed to sit down and let a couple of McKenzies
take away my claims."</p>

<p>At once Weimer became alert and combative.
The McKenzies should not take the claims.</p>

<p>"You see how it is," Steele began as he and
Ross were carrying the cases of dynamite "sticks"
up the trail to the tunnel in which Weimer was
doing the assessment work for the four tracts to
which he had laid claim. "Mentally Weimer has
become suddenly an old and childish man while
retaining all his physical powers. He can do the
work of two ordinary men if he can be made to
work&#8211;and it&#8217;s up to you to compel him. Otherwise,
by the first of next July, at the time when
these claims ought to be patented, you will have
to forfeit &#8217;em."</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s heart sank. "The first of next July,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
and it was then but the middle of October! He
laid the case of sticks down on the ore-dump, and,
glancing up at the peaks which held him a
prisoner, caught his breath in a gust of rebellion.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the tunnel, some seven feet
high and eight wide, was the "dump," to the edge
of which ran a rusty track with a "bumper" at
the end. The track extended into the tunnel.
On it stood a lumbering vehicle, consisting of the
trucks of a hand car, on which was fastened a
home-made box to carry ore.</p>

<p>"This," explained Steele, "is a remnant of
Weimer&#8217;s better days. There was no way to pack
a regular car over here, and he devised this. He
was a smart man until last year."</p>

<p>After dinner, which Weimer prepared,&#8211;Ross
found him always ready to prepare food and eat
it,&#8211;Steele suggested that they "drop in" on the
McKenzies.</p>

<p>"Especially," he added, his eyes scanning Ross&#8217;s
face, "after your meeting Sandy on the way to
Cody."</p>

<p>Ross hesitated. "I don&#8217;t know about that," he
objected, surprised that Steele should suggest such
a thing. "Wouldn&#8217;t it be a bit queer for me to
call on my &#8217;friends the enemy&#8217;?"</p>

<p>Steele laughed, but held strongly to his point.
"Not queer at all. There&#8217;s no object in not being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
on a speakin&#8217;-footing with &#8217;em," he said. "There&#8217;s
nothing to be gained and a lot to be lost by openly
recognizing what they&#8217;re waiting for. You&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to get almighty lonesome up here,"&#8211;involuntarily
Ross swallowed, and turned his face
away,&#8211;"and that Sandy McKenzie is good company&#8211;on
the surface. I can&#8217;t say as much for the
other, Waymart, but he&#8217;ll pass."</p>

<p>The sun was shining warmly when they left
Weimer&#8217;s cabin. The snow above the narrow
loam-paved trail was melting and running in
rivulets down to the creek. Overhead the spruce
boughs met, and laced their green fingers together,
sending down a damp, spicy odor.</p>

<p>Near the McKenzie cabin Steele paused and
looked up the mountainside. A few rods away
the earth was thrown up around some tree stumps
whose tops had been recently cut off.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained in a low tone to Ross,
"the McKenzies are supposed to be over here
working some claims that they staked out last
spring. But look there! They haven&#8217;t got the
discovery hole finished yet!"</p>

<p>The "discovery hole," as Ross had learned, must
be dug within thirty days after the staking of the
claim, and is a name given to the ten feet of
development work required by the law of Wyoming.
This ten feet of digging may mark either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
the commencement of a tunnel if the claim is
located on the side of a mountain, or, if the claim
is on level ground, the hole takes the form of a
shaft driven perpendicularly into the earth. With
a claim thus staked and developed, the owner
may rest secure for one year without further work.
Then, in order to hold the claim against any
covetous claim "jumper" he must do one hundred
dollars&#8217; worth of development work a year for five
years in order to obtain a patent. If he has staked
several adjacent claims, work for all may be done
in one shaft or tunnel.</p>

<p>Ross, merely glancing at the incomplete discovery
hole, looked at the cabin from which the
sound of voices issued. His gaze was doubtful,
and his footsteps lagged.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Steele walked on briskly, rapped on
the sagging door, threw it open, and brought
Ross reluctantly face to face with his "friends the
enemy."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MEN OF MEADOW CREEK</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Sandy McKenzie</span> sat before a rough board table
on which his elbows lazily rested, supporting half
his weight. Sandy needed no gymnasium exercises
to teach him relaxation. Before him were
the remains of a hearty dinner, the chief dish of
which smelled to Ross like beefsteak. From this
dish from time to time Sandy forked bits of meat
on which he leisurely chewed.</p>

<p>He wore the same garb in which Ross had first
seen him; but the corduroy trousers were much
the worse for wear and dirt, and it had been weeks
since his face had felt a razor. His sandy hair
also had increased in length, one thick lock perpetually
dangling over his forehead.</p>

<p>Waymart, an older and darker man than Sandy,
lay in his bunk smoking, his knees drawn up and
his hands clasped around them. Waymart was
clean shaven, and his black hair was closely
clipped.</p>

<p>Both Sandy and Waymart were surprised to see
Ross at their cabin door, but Sandy favored him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
with a delighted grin. Rising without disturbing
the box on which he had been sitting, he straddled
across it, and held out a cordial hand.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tenderfoot," he shouted. "I hear
they&#8217;ve added Doc to that there name since I see
you last."</p>

<p>Waymart crawled slowly out of his bunk. His
black eyes met Ross&#8217;s an instant, and then slid
away, the lids drooping. He held out a hand
which, although larger than Sandy&#8217;s, lacked its
cordial grip.</p>

<p>"Have some chairs," Sandy invited gayly, kicking
forward a couple of boxes. "These here are
our second-best plush, upholstered, <i>ma</i>hogany affairs.
The best are coming from Chicago when
the Burlington Road gets into Camp."</p>

<p>There was about Sandy such an air of gay irresponsibility
and cordiality that Ross brightened
perceptibly. After all, his "friends the enemy"
might not be bad neighbors, and he was glad he
had allowed Steele to persuade him to come.</p>

<p>Pushing his box away from the red-hot stove,
he tipped it up on end, and sat down beside the
only window the cabin afforded. Directly outside,
hanging to a tree, were the hind quarters of a
beef, as Ross supposed at first glance. But, chancing
to glance down, he found himself looking at
the head of an elk with great branching antlers, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
head such as he had seen at "The Irma" in Cody,
credited to the marksmanship of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>"Last week," he heard Waymart saying to
Steele, "we got him over near the Divide."</p>

<p>Ross opened his eyes in astonishment. "A
week!" he exclaimed, glancing from the table to
the meat hanging uncovered and unprotected outside.</p>

<p>Sandy caught the expression, and slapped his
leg gleefully. "Think that there meat ought to
be off color by this time, don&#8217;t ye, Doc? Well,
let me tell ye we&#8217;ll be eatin&#8217; on it hangin&#8217; just
where it is until it&#8217;s gone; and the last bite will
be as good as the first."</p>

<p>Steele explained. "The air up here cures meat,
Grant, quite as well as brine. It takes meat a
mighty long time to spoil&#8211;in fact, if it&#8217;s properly
jerked, it never spoils."</p>

<p>"&#8217;Jerked&#8217;?" interrogated Ross: but Sandy
had launched into an account of their hunt over on
the Divide, and no one explained the "jerking"
process then.</p>

<p>As Sandy talked, his manner lost its laziness.
He became animated, laughing and gesticulating
constantly, and occasionally running his fingers
through his hair and throwing the stray front lock
back among its fellows.</p>

<p>Waymart had lain back in his bunk again, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
unceremoniously elevated his knees, between
which he glanced at Ross from time to time. He
said but little, and smiled less.</p>

<p>The two occupied a cabin similar to Weimer&#8217;s
except that it was cleaner. In one corner was a
heap of supplies, boxes of canned goods, and sacks
of flour. Seeing Steele&#8217;s eyes on these, Sandy explained
easily:</p>

<p>"Hain&#8217;t packed over our winter&#8217;s supplies yet
except the sticks. Got a plenty of them, but
grub&#8217;s gettin&#8217; pretty low."</p>

<p>"Better hurry up, then," remarked Steele in a
careless fashion. "All the horses in Camp will be
sent below in a couple of weeks."</p>

<p>By "below" he meant the ranches of Wood
River Valley.</p>

<p>Sandy pushed back his front lock. "Time
enough," he returned lightly. "Everything can
wait except game-huntin&#8217;. There&#8217;s a flock of
mountain sheep over on the north side of Crosby,
and we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to trail &#8217;em to-morrow." Then
he turned hospitably to Ross. "Want to go
along?"</p>

<p>Ross shook his head. "I&#8217;ve&#8211;I&#8217;ve got to work,"
he stammered, embarrassed at being obliged to introduce
the subject of work on the Weimer-Grant
claims.</p>

<p>He might have saved himself all embarrassment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
as the subject seemed to have no personal connection
with the gay Sandy.</p>

<p>"What," he cried, "in huntin&#8217; season? Wall,
I&#8217;ve met other tenderfeet constituted like ye; but
they soon git over the fit, and so will you, I reckon.
Brought a gun?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You&#8217;ll be out with us yet," declared Sandy.</p>

<p>"Sure," came from the bunk in tones of certainty.</p>

<p>Ross said nothing.</p>

<p>"When you bring down your first buck," pursued
Sandy, unruffled by the boy&#8217;s silence, "you&#8217;ll
begin to git the Western fever that ye said ye
didn&#8217;t want." Here Sandy chortled. "Guess ye
think ye&#8217;re enough of a doctor t&#8217; cure that fever,
but wait and see!"</p>

<p>As he said this, there was in the speaker&#8217;s manner,
or in his blue eyes or sandy-bearded face, a
return of that subtle something which had caused
Ross to decide that he "partly liked him and
partly didn&#8217;t."</p>

<p>"I expect," said Steele laughingly, "that Doc
here will get as quartz crazy as Wishing Wilson is.
Of course, you fellows have seen Wishing."</p>

<p>"Wishin&#8217; Wilson!" exclaimed Sandy and
Waymart in one breath, Sandy adding, "What do
ye mean? Whereabouts is Wishin&#8217;?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>"Well! Well! How comes it you didn&#8217;t
know?" exclaimed Steele wonderingly. "Wishing
is right up here in your midst. He&#8217;s holding
down his claims this minute up yonder," jerking
his thumb over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Sandy sat up and threw the lock out of his eyes.
"Back to stay?" he asked with his forehead
puckering into a scowl.</p>

<p>Steele nodded. "Stay till the trail is shut up."</p>

<p>The scowl on Sandy&#8217;s forehead deepened.
"Thought Wishin&#8217; was on the hog&#8217;s back. Last I
knew he was tryin&#8217; to sell out to a party in Omaha.
When did he come?"</p>

<p>Waymart crawled out of his bunk again and
lighted his pipe. "We&#8217;ve been hunting&#8217;," he explained,
"ye know. Didn&#8217;t git back &#8217;til yesterday.
Place may be full of folks and we none the
wiser!"</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re crowded up here yet,"
Steele rejoined. "And Wishing didn&#8217;t come until&#8211;when
was it?&#8211;only a few days ago, he and his
new partner."</p>

<p>"Pardner?" cried Sandy.</p>

<p>"Pardner!" echoed Waymart, holding his pipe
in his hand. "What pardner?"</p>

<p>"Young chap," replied Steele, "about Doc&#8217;s
height and&#8211;what age should you say, Doc?"</p>

<p>"Probably seventeen," returned Ross. "Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
much over," adding, "his name is Jones, Leslie
Jones. He&#8217;s from Omaha."</p>

<p>"Grub stake?" asked Waymart succinctly.</p>

<p>"More than that," answered Steele. "Jones is
going to stay and help."</p>

<p>The scowl on Sandy&#8217;s forehead smoothed itself
out. He grinned genially at Ross. "I wonder
now," he mused, "if there&#8217;s enough of us old goats
up here in Meadow Greek to round up the kids
and take care of &#8217;em!"</p>

<p>"What about the kids taking care of the goats?"
laughed Steele. "Sometimes they&#8217;re bigger hustlers."</p>

<p>Sandy nodded lightly. "This air&#8217;ll take the
hustle out quick enough. Such high mountains
as these hain&#8217;t made fer hustlers."</p>

<p>As Ross was returning with Steele to Weimer&#8217;s
shack, the superintendent glanced at him sidewise.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t believe," he said slowly, "that the
McKenzies intend to winter here. Of course,
there&#8217;s no object in their stayin&#8217;. We all know
they&#8217;re not here to work their claims, and it isn&#8217;t
necessary to stay in order to watch yours; and
they&#8217;ve no winter supplies, nor," thoughtfully,
"have they mud-chinked their cabin. You can
see daylight anywhere between the logs. No, I
don&#8217;t think they have any intention of staying."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>Ross looked around the tiny valley, with its
fringe of windy, inaccessible peaks, and thought
of the long months ahead of him, shut in among
those cruelly cold mountains.</p>

<p>"I hope they stay!" he declared fervently.</p>

<p>An hour later, having talked over the situation
with Ross thoroughly, explained the amount of
work necessary to be done in the tunnel, and
given Weimer large chunks of advice, Steele rode
away, driving his packhorses in front of him.</p>

<p>Ross watched him out of sight and then entered
the shack whistling to keep his courage up.
Inside he surveyed his temporary home with a
shiver which stopped the whistle. "Uncle Jake,"
he suggested, "let&#8217;s clean house the rest of the
day. Willing?"</p>

<p>Weimer, sitting on a box in front of the stove,
assented without removing the pipe from his lips.
"Ja, clean up all you vant to. I tink your fader
was alvays vantin&#8217; to clean mit der house."</p>

<p>"Think of my father&#8217;s ever cleaning out a cabin
like this!" muttered Ross.</p>

<p>He stood helplessly in front of the door looking
from the complacently smoking Weimer to the
bags and boxes heaped on the floor and then
around the dirt-encrusted room. He thought of
Aunt Anne and her perfectly kept house with a
great throb of homesickness. Then he thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
his father, who had got his "start" under such conditions
as these and suddenly threw off his coat.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s got to be done," he said aloud, "and I&#8217;ve
got to do it!"</p>

<p>"Vat?" asked Weimer stupidly turning his goggles
in Ross&#8217;s direction. Weimer was hugging his
knees in a state of blissful content, the smoke from
his pipe curling about his head and almost shutting
from view the big young man on whose
shoulders he had already shifted all burdens connected
with the Grant-Weimer claims.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day Ross worked
cleaning up the cabin and packing away their
winter supplies. When night came his bunk
looked better to him than the supper which Weimer
was preparing, and he dropped asleep sitting
beside the table waiting for the flapjacks. But,
instead of turning in directly after washing the
supper dishes, as he had intended, he was forced
to keep awake until nine o&#8217;clock entertaining the
denizens of Meadow Creek Valley.</p>

<p>The McKenzies came over first. Weimer, who,
when night approached, had removed his goggles,
saw them coming first and raised his voice in
protest.</p>

<p>"Ach! dem McKenzies! See here, poy, dey
mustn&#8217;t come mit my cabin. Dey ist after dese
claims. Vorstehen sie nicht?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>"Yes, yes, Uncle Jake, I understand," Ross returned
soothingly. "But they can&#8217;t carry the
claims away in their pockets to-night, and to-morrow
morning we are going to bone down to work
at such a rate that they&#8217;ll come up missing on
their calculations altogether."</p>

<p>At the mention of work, Weimer groaned and
retiring precipitately to his bunk lay there regarding
the doorway hostilely through the smoke from
his pipe. The next minute the doorway framed
Sandy with Waymart close behind.</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc!" Sandy pushed his cap to the
back of his head. "Mart and I, we&#8217;ve started out
fer to pay our respects to Wishin&#8217; Wilson. Want
t&#8217; hike along with us?"</p>

<p>Ross shrugged his shoulders and sat down on
one end of the table, dish-cloth in hand. "Guess
I&#8217;ve had hiking enough for one day, McKenzie.
Let&#8217;s see. It&#8217;s two miles up there, isn&#8217;t it?"</p>

<p>"Yep;" Sandy lounged in and sat down on a
box. "And by th&#8217; same sign it&#8217;s two miles back.
But, gosh, young man, a matter of four mile ain&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; in this country!" He surveyed Ross
curiously. "How d&#8217;ye travel East? In a push
cart?"</p>

<p>Ross grinned but flushed. "The trip over from
Camp was on rather higher ground than I&#8217;ve ever
seen before and it&#8211;well&#8211;it winded me," frankly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
"And this afternoon I&#8217;ve been hoeing out here.
So I&#8217;m not exactly as fresh as a morning glory to-night."</p>

<p>Waymart came inside and looked around. Ross
pushed a box in his direction and, after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation and a civil nod in the direction
of the bunk, the older McKenzie sat down and
pulled his pipe out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Sandy. "When you&#8217;re a
few months further away from Pennsylvany you&#8217;ll
forgit that a shack needs a hoe, t&#8217; say nothin&#8217; of a
broom." Then he addressed the bunk without
looking toward it. "Uncle Jake, have you seen
Wishin&#8217;?"</p>

<p>"Ja," growled Weimer uncivilly, "dat I have."</p>

<p>"How did he look?" smiled Sandy who seemed
to enjoy the other&#8217;s "grouch."</p>

<p>"Look?" violently. "Vy, how should he look
but shust like himself!"</p>

<p>Waymart chuckled, and Sandy was about to reply
when footsteps were heard drawing near.
Heavy shoes were crunching the stones and pine
needles under foot, and voices sounded louder and
louder.</p>

<p>"Must be Wilson and Jones," said Ross going to
the door.</p>

<p>The room was lighted by two miner&#8217;s candlesticks
driven into the side logs. One candle was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
near the door, and the light fell on the genial face
of Wishing Wilson, who paused in the doorway to
wring Ross&#8217;s hand and shout his greetings at the
other occupants of the room, before stepping in
and allowing his young partner to enter. When
Ross finally held out his hand to Leslie Jones he
knew that he was facing a boy as homesick as himself,
rather than "Queen Victory&#8217;s youngest."</p>

<p>Leslie gripped the other&#8217;s hand as though its
owner were a lifelong friend. "How do you make
it up here?" he asked in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t make it yet," responded Ross. "I just
got here to-day. Steele came up with me."</p>

<p>Then he turned to introduce Leslie to the McKenzies
and saw a tableau which puzzled him.</p>

<p>Waymart was staring at Leslie with amazed eyes
and a lower jaw that slightly sagged. He held his
pipe in front of his mouth surprised in the act of adjusting
it between his lips. Sandy, rising, came
blithely forward, and, in passing Waymart, stumbled
and jostled against him. Waymart instantly
recovered his lost poise. Lowering his pipe he
slouched along behind Sandy and shook hands with
Wilson&#8217;s partner. Wilson himself was over beside
Weimer&#8217;s bunk telling at the top of his voice that
he had come to a rock wall in his tunnel, and on
the other side there must, without fail, be either a
pocket of free gold or a lead that would make the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
claims among the most valuable in the Shoshones.
To this optimistic talk Leslie did not listen with
the same absorbing interest he had shown at Sagehen
Roost, Ross noticed.</p>

<p>In fact, a week of loneliness, coarse food and
hard work had wilted Leslie Jones both physically
and mentally. Abject weariness seemed to have
robbed him of a part of his absorbing self-esteem.
Furthermore, he appeared to Ross to be troubled
as well as homesick. He looked at Sandy and
Waymart unrecognizingly and sat down on a
bench beneath the candle by the stove.</p>

<p>"We shall stay," Ross heard Wishing tell the
McKenzies, "till the pass over Crosby threatens.
Then we&#8217;ll hike it below to the coal claims."</p>

<p>"Didn&#8217;t know you had any," interrupted Sandy.
"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Up Wood River, only about a mile or such a
matter from Camp. Fine outcroppin&#8217; of coal.
Best in the country. When the Burlington gits
here they&#8217;ve got t&#8217; have coal and I says to myself,
&#8217;There&#8217;s where you come up on top, Wishin&#8217;, you&#8217;ll
have th&#8217; coal t&#8217; sell &#8217;em,&#8217; me and my pard now,"
he added with a glance at Jones.</p>

<p>The boy looked at him vaguely, as though he
had not heard, and nodded. He sat with one
knee thrown over the other, his back pressed
against the side logs, his eyes so heavy that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
lids kept drooping despite his efforts to keep
awake. His hands were blistered, and his new
corduroy suit dirty and torn. The air of newness
which had characterized him when Ross first met
him was gone. His hair had lengthened, and his
cheeks revealed hollows. He said but little, being
engaged in the absorbing effort to keep awake.
Besides, Sandy and Wilson gave no one else a
chance to talk. Waymart smoked stolidly staring
at the candle above Leslie.</p>

<p>Ross, sitting with his elbows on the table, ceased
to struggle against weariness, and, with his head
on his arms, fell asleep. He awakened just in
time to see his callers depart, whereupon he threw
himself, dressed, in his bunk and slept until late
the next morning.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks, all days seemed alike
to Ross except Sunday. Early each Sunday morning
he struck the trail for Miners&#8217; Camp, the post-office,
and Steele&#8217;s shack. At first he crept shudderingly
over that quarter mile around the shoulder
of Crosby. But soon his head lost every sense of
giddiness, and his legs regained their accustomed
strength, and his heart ceased to beat agitatedly at
sight of the thousand-feet fall.</p>

<p>On the third Sunday he came into Steele&#8217;s shack
with a brighter face than he had worn before.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/i-134.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
HE STRUCK THE TRAIL
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>"Things are sort of righting themselves," he
reported over a hot elk steak. "I&#8217;m getting Weimer
down to work in dead earnest," chuckling. "I
hold the McKenzie boys before his mind&#8217;s eye
continually, and roll that car out, and dump it so
quickly that he has to step lively to get enough
ore picked out and blasted out to fill it."</p>

<p>Steele whistled when Ross told him how many
cubic feet had been taken out of the Weimer-Grant
tunnel during the week. He took from his pocket
a paper and pencil, and fell to figuring. Ross
pushed aside the empty dishes, and, leaning across
the table, looked on with interest. He, too, had
figured extensively since work began on Meadow
Creek, but only during the last week had the
figures satisfied him.</p>

<p>"Why, man alive!" cried Steele after a few moments&#8217;
silent work, "you&#8217;ll fetch it, at this rate."
He stretched his hand across the table impetuously,
and gripped Ross&#8217;s, adding, "I thought you could
never do it&#8211;even with a backbone."</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s shoulders straightened, and his face
flushed boyishly. "We <i>must</i> fetch it!"</p>

<p>Steele leaned back, and drummed on the table.
"What about the McKenzies? Of course they
must know what progress you&#8217;ve made."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Ross, "I hope I can keep
&#8217;em so interested guessing that they&#8217;ll stay all
winter. They come over as socially as you please
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
about every evening. Weimer doesn&#8217;t like it
much. He has no use for &#8217;em, but I have, you
bet! I&#8217;m glad to have &#8217;em around, especially
now when I can estimate that at the present rate
of speed the tunnel will be ready so we can apply
for a patent by June."</p>

<p>To Dr. and Mrs. Grant, Ross wrote: "It&#8217;s going
to be a long pull and a strong pull, but I shall
stick to the ship and show father that I can do
something else besides setting a bone.</p>

<p>"And what&#8217;s more and queerer, I&#8217;m in danger
of getting interested in gold mining for itself.
Every time I push our little car out to the end
of the dump and unload the ore I wonder how
much gold I&#8217;m watching roll away down the incline.
Aunt Anne, you said in your last that it
seems such a waste to throw away the ore. Well,
if you were here you&#8217;d find it a greater waste of
good money to try to get money out of the quartz
under present conditions. You see there are only
a few dollars&#8217; worth of gold in a ton of rock. That
ton would have to be &#8217;packed,&#8217; as they say here,
eighty miles over the roughest of trails to Cody,
and there loaded on cars and sent clear to Omaha,
our nearest smelter. And I guess you know more
than I do about the costly process of crushing ore
and extracting gold from it in a smelter. It&#8217;s not
like mining for &#8217;pay dirt,&#8217; as the men here call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
placer mining, where you gather up sand and wash
it out yourself and find the particles of gold in the
bottom of your pan. This quartz digging is the
most expensive kind of mining there is. But
when the Burlington gets the branch road up into
Miners&#8217; the ore can be loaded at the mines and
unloaded in Omaha without change of cars. Then
we&#8217;ll dig out the dumps and send them to the
smelter, and back will come the gold jingling
into our pockets. But whenever I&#8217;m moved to
give you information I feel small, for I believe,
in spite of all you write, that you both know more
than I do about it now.</p>

<p>"I haven&#8217;t had a book in my hand, Uncle Fred.
When it comes night, I am too tired to understand
the newspapers that I bring over from Miners&#8217;,
to say nothing of delving in histology. I expect
I shall forget all I ever knew, but never mind!
If I can get those claims patented, and so satisfy
father, then next year I&#8217;ll begin over again to fit
myself for college&#8211;guess what I knew once will
come back when I&#8217;ve studied a little. Anyway,
I&#8217;m not going to worry about it now."</p>

<p>Ross underscored those last words to convince
himself that he was not worrying, and handed the
letter over to Bill Travers to be mailed at Meeteetse.</p>

<p>To his father Ross proudly wrote of the week&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
progress in the tunnel, adding in reply to a rather
longer letter than usual, which he found awaiting
him in Camp, "No, I have no intention of throwing
up the job."</p>

<p>His father had opened the way wide for him to
"throw up the job" after receiving the letter he
had requested Steele to fill with exact information.
That part of the information which stated that
Ross must necessarily be shut up in Meadow
Creek Valley for months with a more or less weak-headed
partner had led to the letter which Ross
found awaiting him. But Ross, Junior, was not
well enough acquainted with Ross, Senior, to understand
that this letter was an invitation for him
to return East.</p>

<p>"He thinks I&#8217;m just chicken-hearted enough to
be ready to cut and run at the first obstacle," was
Ross&#8217;s thought when he read what his father had
written. His chin came up, and his eyes narrowed.
"I&#8217;d stay and work here a year before I&#8217;d
show the white feather now."</p>

<p>Ever since his last visit to New York, Ross had
dwelt with secret pride on the respect and confidence
that his father had shown him, and the
sensation was so new and pleasant that he had no
intention of forfeiting it.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that, with Grant, Senior,
and Dr. Grant and Aunt Anne all desiring Ross&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
presence at home, and with Ross&#8217;s wishes coinciding
exactly with theirs, he remained at the "jumping-off
place" into the wilderness.</p>

<p>In his private office on Broadway, Grant, Senior,
read and reread, "No, I have no intention of
throwing up the job." He twisted uneasily in his
swivel-chair. He pulled Steele&#8217;s last letter out of
a pigeonhole, read it, frowned, and replaced it.
Then he leaned back and admitted aloud:</p>

<p>"I wish the boy was safely entered in medical
college."</p>

<p>But, even as he considered the matter, "the
boy" with a small pack on his back, candy and a
few apples to eat as a relish with the canned stuff,
was plodding through the snow, light and easily
brushed aside as yet, over the trail between Miners&#8217;
Camp and Meadow Creek. And the boy&#8217;s heart
was growing as courageous as his muscles were
strong.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>HALF-CONFIDENCES</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> was dark that night when Ross arrived at
the Weimer shack. The candles were lighted, and
as he passed the window, he saw Leslie Jones
within, sitting on a box on the opposite side of the
room. His elbows were on the table, and he was
listening to Weimer, or rather, pretending to listen.
At a glance, Ross saw that his thoughts were far
afield, his eyes being fixed on the speaker with an
absent stare. He appeared more unkempt than on
the occasion of his first call, and his face was
thinner. There was also about him an air of collapse
that made him a different person from the
overbearing young man who had issued lofty
orders at Sagehen Roost.</p>

<p>It was the second time that Ross had seen him
since coming into the valley. The week before he
had gone with the McKenzies one evening to the
Jones claims, but the two boys had exchanged few
remarks, both being too tired to talk.</p>

<p>As Ross entered the shack a sudden thought
struck him. He stopped in the doorway and
greeted Jones with, "See here! Why haven&#8217;t I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
thought to get your mail Sundays? You haven&#8217;t
been over to Camp at all, have you?"</p>

<p>Leslie moved uneasily. He picked up his cap
and pulled at the rim. "Aw&#8211;it&#8217;s bully of you to
think of my mail, but I&#8217;m not expecting&#8211;why,
yes, you might inquire," he added lamely. Then,
"What&#8217;s going on in Camp? I&#8217;d like to hear
something about people once more," with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>Ross unstrapped a pack from his back and threw
the contents on the table. Sorting out the week&#8217;s
papers, he tossed them across the table. "&#8217;Omaha
News.&#8217; Want to see it?"</p>

<p>The blood came in an unexpected rush to Leslie&#8217;s
face and his hand trembled as he reached for
the papers. Ross watched him as he took them
and scanned the headings, column by column.
Then he glanced keenly over the advertisements,
and without reading further threw the papers
aside and rested his elbows despondently on the
table.</p>

<p>Weimer, satisfied with the tobacco and candy
that Ross had brought, retired to his bunk, dozing
and smoking by turns. Ross had seated himself
at the table opposite Leslie and reread his letters.
Now, as the other cast the papers aside, he looked
up and met misery in the eyes leveled at him
from beneath his caller&#8217;s lengthening hair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>"Say!" ejaculated Ross impulsively, "I bet you
find it as awful up in this country as I do!"</p>

<p>"Awful!" echoed Leslie. "It&#8217;s<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" A sudden
working in his throat stopped him. He
turned his face away.</p>

<p>"I wouldn&#8217;t stay here for all the gold in these
mountains if things weren&#8217;t just as they are," Ross
continued sympathetically, "and I presume you&#8217;re
caught in some such way, too, or you&#8217;d get out."</p>

<p>Leslie hesitated, nodded and again faced Ross,
"How are you caught?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Ross told him briefly about his father&#8217;s interest
in the claims and Weimer&#8217;s appeal for help that
had led to his, Ross&#8217;s, coming.</p>

<p>As he talked Leslie&#8217;s eagerness evaporated. He
evidently was looking for another sort of explanation,
and his response was only half-hearted:</p>

<p>"Then your father sent you. That&#8217;s bad luck
when you want to be in school." He hesitated and
added: "It&#8217;s not every fellow that wants to go to
school. I hate it!"</p>

<p>"You do!" exclaimed Ross. "Well, I can&#8217;t say
I waste any love on studying myself, that is, in
most studies, but I&#8217;m after results. I&#8217;m willing to
bone down to work because of where the work will
take me. The only thing I really like to study is
medicine, anatomy and all that sort of thing, you
know. But in order to get anywhere in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
profession, I have to take a lot of mathematics and
language and things that I detest."</p>

<p>Leslie&#8217;s shoulders came up. "I won&#8217;t study
what I don&#8217;t like," he declared arrogantly, "and I
can&#8217;t be made to&#8211;guess they&#8217;re finding that out,
too!" The last was under his breath.</p>

<p>"Well," Ross began vaguely, "if you want to be
a business man it&#8217;s not necessary to go through
college. Our most successful business men<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"
His voice trailed into silence as he saw that the
other was not listening.</p>

<p>There ensued a few moments of quiet. In the
bunk Weimer snored gently. A nickel clock suspended
on a peg from the side logs ticked loudly.
The pine chunks in the sheet-iron stove cracked
and snapped cheerfully. Leslie stared dejectedly
at the table, while Ross, his forehead knit into a
puzzled frown, stared at Leslie. What could have
happened, he asked himself, to rob the other in
four weeks of his former desire to turn prospector?
Homesickness? Perhaps, but Ross decided
the trouble lay deeper. If it were mere
homesickness, the boy would be haunting Miners&#8217;
Camp and the post-office or else clearing out of the
mountains.</p>

<p>"Where&#8217;s Wilson?" Ross asked finally.</p>

<p>Leslie aroused himself with difficulty. "He&#8217;s
over at the McKenzies&#8217;. I came here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>"How&#8217;s the tunnel going? Are you making
headway?"</p>

<p>This question opened the flood-gates of Leslie&#8217;s
misery. "Headway?" he burst out. "Yes, we&#8217;re
making headway, but toward what, I&#8217;d like to
know!"</p>

<p>It was an exclamation rather than a question,
and the boy brought his clenched fist down violently
on the table.</p>

<p>"Why," stammered Ross, "toward getting the
claims patented, I suppose. What else did you
expect?"</p>

<p>Leslie&#8217;s excitement subsided. He folded his
arms on the table. "I came expecting to find
gold," he confessed. "I could hardly wait to get
here and now&#8211;well, I&#8217;m here, that&#8217;s all, and all
my money is spent for supplies."</p>

<p>"But didn&#8217;t you understand," Ross began, "that
the ore up here had to be smelted in order to release
the metal, and that we can never pack the ore
on horseback over these trails and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"No," cried Leslie fiercely, "I didn&#8217;t understand.
I understood that I was coming to work
claims that would surely prove a perfect Klondike
in a short time&#8211;I thought in a few weeks."</p>

<p>"Oh, that&#8217;s Wilson," broke in Ross. "He&#8217;s a
perfect promoter, Steele tells me, because he believes
in things himself so intensely that he makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
you see his way in spite of yourself. Steele says
he has been quartz crazy for years. Every claim
that he stakes holds his everlasting fortune in
prospect."</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ve found that out," assented Leslie bitterly,
"and yet I can&#8217;t blame Wilson. I foisted myself
on him at Omaha&#8211;he didn&#8217;t get after me. And he
has really been square with me. He simply made
me believe in his claims as thoroughly as he does,
and he believes in them yet, but I don&#8217;t. You
see," Leslie explained, "he keeps expecting to run
across a pocket of free gold, and that he says he&#8217;ll
turn over to me so I can get back the money I put
into the supplies. I&#8217;ve got to get that money back
pretty soon," he added emphatically.</p>

<p>Ross looked at him commiseratingly. "I&#8217;m
afraid you can&#8217;t."</p>

<p>For a moment Leslie&#8217;s lips worked miserably.
He took no pains to conceal his emotion from
Ross. Finally he burst out, "I must, Grant. I&#8217;ve
simply got to have that money back." He held
out his hands palms up. They were blistered and
sore. "That doesn&#8217;t matter," he declared. "I&#8217;d
work &#8217;em to the bone if the work would bring the
gold. And a month ago I&#8217;d never done an hour&#8217;s
work in my life. I tell you," in a burst of irrepressible
confidence, "everything looks different to
me to-day from what it did five weeks ago. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
wish&#8211;I wish I could go back those five weeks&#8211;why,
I&#8217;d almost be willing to go to school<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Approaching sounds stopped the confidence that
Ross was so anxious to hear. The door opened
unceremoniously, and the McKenzies entered, accompanied
by Wilson. The latter was talking excitedly.
With a nod at Ross he finished his speech
while helping himself to a seat beside the stove.</p>

<p>"I tell you there&#8217;s every sign of free gold. Same
kind of stun crops out there and in the same layers
and at the same angle as when I was working
up in Butte. My claims was right next door to a
fellow&#8217;s named Harrison. One mornin&#8217; he bust
through a wall rock slam bang right onto two
thousand dollars&#8217; worth of the prettiest yellow ye
ever see. And I tell ye I shouldn&#8217;t be a mite surprised
if our next blast showed us a streak of yellow
too."</p>

<p>Sandy laughed unconcernedly. "A streak of
yeller in a chap and in a rock mean two different
things, I notice. And I&#8217;ve also seen more of the
yeller in fellers than in rocks," easily dropping on
a box and lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>Young Jones, looking at his partner, brightened
visibly, despite the knowledge he had recently acquired
of Wilson&#8217;s optimism. There was about
the man such a cock-sureness, such simple sincerity
and abiding faith in his own statements that Ross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
felt that he could not rest content the following
day without knowing the result of that next
charge of dynamite.</p>

<p>Steele had told him about these "pockets" that
occasionally are concealed in the heart of the veins
or "leads" along which mining tunnels are driven.
They are uncovered unexpectedly by a blast of
dynamite. They consist of small quantities of
quartz of such richness that it pays to transport
the ore to the smelter. But every prospector
dreams of uncovering a pocket of "free gold" ore,
quartz through which the gold is scattered in visible
particles or streaks and can be extracted in its pure
state with the aid of a hammer and a knife blade.</p>

<p>"Come down to-morrow night," Ross said in a
low tone across the table, "and report."</p>

<p>Leslie nodded, and Ross, going to his emergency
chest, brought out a bottle of liquid and a box of
salve. "Here," he said abruptly, "better take
some care of those hands of yours if you don&#8217;t
want blood poisoning to set in. Soak &#8217;em well in
hot water with a teaspoonful of this added"&#8211;he
shoved the bottle of liquid across the table&#8211;"and
then rub in this salve. And don&#8217;t work in the
dirt without gloves till those sores are healed."</p>

<p>Humbly and gratefully Leslie took his orders
from "Doc Tenderfoot," while the men looked on
with interest and many questions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>"Tell ye what," said Sandy heartily, "if I intended
t&#8217; winter here I&#8217;d feel easier about the trail
bein&#8217; closed. If a stick should go off at the wrong
time and blow ye int&#8217; pieces, Doc here could put
th&#8217; pieces together and patch ye up as good as new.
Doc&#8217;s all right!"</p>

<p>"I wish," thought Ross as he saw his guests depart,
"that I could say the same about Sandy."</p>

<p>But while he had no faith in the friendly pretentions
of Sandy, he dreaded any mention of his
leaving the mountains. To feel that he would be
left alone with Weimer for months was maddening.
If only Wilson and his partner were to remain
on the Creek&#8211;but they too would go as soon
as the trail threatened to become impassable.
This careless speech of Sandy&#8217;s concerning leaving
the valley drove all other ideas out of Ross&#8217;s head
that night and persisted in the morning. To feel
that Weimer and himself were the only human
beings in Meadow Creek Valley, to know that
there was no escape until the sun thawed away the
barrier in the spring was a terrifying thought. It
was present that day with Ross like a waking
nightmare. As he pushed the little car out of the
tunnel and dumped it, he looked up at the cold
gray peaks with a wild desire to level them and
bring Miners&#8217; Camp&#8211;Cody&#8211;Pennsylvania&#8211;nearer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
So absorbing was this desire that he forgot
the promised visit from Leslie and was surprised
to see him at the door before he had finished
washing the supper dishes.</p>

<p>"You wanted to hear about that promised vein,"
explained the newcomer, reading Ross&#8217;s surprise
in his face.</p>

<p>"Oh&#8211;why, yes! That pocket of free gold!"
exclaimed Ross hastily picking up the thread of
connection where it had been broken the previous
evening by Sandy&#8217;s reference to leaving the valley.
"Did you uncover it?"</p>

<p>"Uncover nothing!" returned Leslie. He sat
on the table and swung his feet restlessly, adding
despondently, "And what&#8217;s more, we won&#8217;t uncover
anything in a lifetime up here, either. I&#8217;ve
lost all hope&#8211;except," he added with a shrug of
his shoulders, "just the minute that Wilson is
talking."</p>

<p>"I never had any hope," said Ross slowly, "but
then, I have never given the ore more than a
thought. With me it&#8217;s simply to get the work
done, satisfy my father and&#8211;clear out."</p>

<p>"And with me," responded Leslie, "it&#8217;s the
money now&#8211;I&#8217;ve got to have the money. Only,"
he added, "I&#8217;ll say this&#8211;that when I left Omaha
there was more in it for me than the money. You
see&#8211;I&#8217;ll own up&#8211;I was crazy to get out of school
and, well&#8211;see things and do &#8217;em! If I&#8217;d gone to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
some other place, to Goldfield or even down to
Miners&#8217; Camp it would be different. But I&#8217;m here
and all my money&#8217;s spent."</p>

<p>Continually he came back to that last statement.
That fact had evidently swallowed up all the lust
for adventure, for "getting out and seeing things"&#8211;it
was the only thing that young Jones could
now see in the situation. Ross wondered why but
did not like to ask. Finally he said hesitatingly,
"I say, Jones, if you want to get out of here I&#8217;ll&#8211;that
is&#8211;I have enough on hand to let you have
your car-fare back to Omaha."</p>

<p>The blood rushed over Leslie&#8217;s face. His head
came up proudly. "See here, Grant," he exclaimed
briskly, sliding off the table and stuffing
his hands into his pockets, "it must sound as if
I&#8217;m a low-down beggar, but I never thought of
such a thing as getting hold of your money!"</p>

<p>"And I never thought of it, either," declared
Ross quickly. "I&#8217;ve made you the offer on my
own hook. Come off your high and mighty perch
and talk sense! Take the money and pay it back
when you can. I&#8217;m a hundred dollars to the good
here."</p>

<p>Leslie "came off his perch" instantly and held
out his hand repentantly. "Thank you, Grant.
That&#8217;s awfully white of you, but that won&#8217;t do.
It&#8217;s not car-fare I want, and Omaha is the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
place I want to strike&#8211;or next to the last, at
least&#8211;without&#8211;well, a lot more than car-fare." After
a moment he repeated, "I tell you it&#8217;s white of you
to offer it, though. It makes a fellow feel as if
he&#8217;d fallen among friends."</p>

<p>The latter expression reminded Ross of something
about which he had not thought in three
weeks, namely, the behavior of Waymart McKenzie
when he first saw Leslie. With the water still
dripping from the dish-pan the boy hung it against
the logs, tossed the dish-cloth on top of the pan
and rolling down his sleeves, asked:</p>

<p>"Jones, do you know the McKenzies?"</p>

<p>Leslie shook his head. "Before coming here,
do you mean?"</p>

<p>Ross nodded.</p>

<p>"No, never saw them before. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," returned Ross carelessly, "only
when you came in here the first night I thought
they acted as though they&#8217;d seen you before, or
Waymart did, rather."</p>

<p>The effect of this simple statement was unexpected.
Leslie gripped the table excitedly. His
face paled and he was obliged to clear his throat
before asking: "What made you think that? I
didn&#8217;t&#8211;didn&#8217;t notice anything. I never thought
that they&#8211;he<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"It was just a trifle that made me think that,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
Ross hastened to assure his guest in confusion.
"Just a little byplay when Waymart first saw you.
Nothing to<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly what it was," commanded
Leslie, and all the boy&#8217;s imperiousness leaped to
the front. "I want to know all that you saw."</p>

<p>Ross related the incident haltingly. "Sandy
didn&#8217;t act as though he had ever seen you before.
It was only Waymart," he said consolingly, but it
was plain to be seen that the other was not consoled.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s possible, very possible that they may have
seen me&#8211;I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed them," he muttered,
"if they were&#8211;that is, father hired any
number of men&#8211;they might all see me and I not
notice them."</p>

<p>"Maybe I can find out," offered Ross promptly.
"I&#8217;ll ask them."</p>

<p>"No, no!" hastily; "don&#8217;t bother with the
matter."</p>

<p>Leslie crossed the room, threw open the door
and stood staring across the valley at the McKenzie
shack. When next he spoke he did not look
around:</p>

<p>"It will be just as well, Grant, if you don&#8217;t mention
me to &#8217;em until<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" There ensued a long
pause. Then, "until I talk with you again."</p>

<p>Just before he left he asked abruptly, "Do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
bring the Omaha papers back with you every
Sunday?"</p>

<p>"I can," replied Ross, "if you want &#8217;em. But,
see here, Jones, why don&#8217;t you go over to Camp
with me next Sunday?"</p>

<p>Leslie hesitated. "Guess I will. Good-night."</p>

<p>A few steps from the door he turned back.
"See here, Grant, don&#8217;t wait for me Sunday. If I
go I&#8217;ll be here by eight o&#8217;clock. But if I don&#8217;t go,
I should like to see the Omaha papers."</p>

<p>"All right, I&#8217;ll fetch them," returned Ross.</p>

<p>Sunday morning he postponed his start for
Miners&#8217; Camp until past eight o&#8217;clock, hoping that
Leslie would come, but no Leslie appeared. Sandy
did, however. He came freshly shaved and
combed, with a new kerchief knotted about his
neck.</p>

<p>"Want some good company over t&#8217; Camp?" he
inquired jocularly. "If ye do, here it is, fer I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; out."</p>

<p>"Going to stay long or just for the day?" asked
Ross.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno how long," carelessly. "I&#8217;ve got
t&#8217; see Cody again. Little old town couldn&#8217;t fetch it
if I didn&#8217;t hang around it about once in so often."</p>

<p>"Is Waymart going?"</p>

<p>"Nope, Mart will hold the cabin and claims
down here. Mart don&#8217;t like t&#8217; hit th&#8217; trail as often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
as I do. He&#8217;s fer his pipe and a soft bunk and a
good meal. Mart &#8217;ud be a failure as one of these
here globe-trotters. He&#8217;s what ye could call
domestic in his tastes. The only thing he lacks,"
here Sandy chuckled at his own wit, "is a blamed
thing to be domestic about!"</p>

<p>As they were making their way cautiously
around the shoulder of Crosby, Sandy asked suddenly,
"Why don&#8217;t that young Jones go t&#8217; Camp
ever on Sunday? Guess they don&#8217;t work Sundays
up t&#8217; th&#8217; Wilson claims. I should think he&#8217;d be as
wild as you be t&#8217; git over this side of Crosby where
there&#8217;s a post-office and newspapers and things."</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t know," returned Ross in a general
denial of knowledge of all Sandy had said.</p>

<p>"I wonder about that young feller now," pursued
Sandy affably.</p>

<p>"So do I!" thought Ross. He said nothing.</p>

<p>"I wonder how he come t&#8217; drop out of nowhere
with money enough t&#8217; grub-stake the two of &#8217;em
fer six months&#8211;and then have nothin&#8217; further t&#8217;
draw on!"</p>

<p>Sandy, walking now shoulder to shoulder with
Ross, looked at him keenly.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t know anything about it," returned Ross
shortly, but he could not rid himself of the insinuation
in Sandy&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>When he returned that night to Meadow Creek,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
Ross was disappointed at finding Wilson awaiting
him as well as Leslie. He had hoped that Leslie
would come for the papers alone and would continue
the conversation of his previous visit.</p>

<p>In a loud and jovial voice Wilson informed Doc
that his pard had started out in good shape that
morning to go over to Camp and had then backed
out.</p>

<p>"Must have got clean over here," Wilson added.</p>

<p>Leslie gathered up the newspapers which Ross
had brought and fitted them together without
meeting Ross&#8217;s eyes. "I found I was too tired to
go on," was all the explanation he made. "I
slept pretty much all day and am going to turn in
early to-night."</p>

<p>Ross nodded speechlessly, wondering how much
Sandy&#8217;s going had to do with Leslie&#8217;s staying.
Would the latter avoid the McKenzies now that
he knew they had seemed to recognize him, and
why? Before the evening was far spent Ross
began to suspect that Leslie would like to avoid
him also, if it were possible. The boy looked
more despondent than ever, but he shielded his
despondency behind a proud reserve that shut
Ross out, much to the latter&#8217;s disappointment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Ross told himself, "if I hadn&#8217;t been
such an idiot as to offer him money, he wouldn&#8217;t
act so offish now. I never had any more tact than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
a goat, anyhow! Wish I had minded my own
business and let him do all the talking!"</p>

<p>"Vas ist de matter mit dot poy?" Weimer asked
as soon as the door closed on their visitors. "He
vas such a talker oder time he vas here und now
he talks nicht at all."</p>

<p>"Guess he&#8217;s homesick."</p>

<p>Weimer rubbed his great hands together thoughtfully.
"Und sick of de mountains, I tink," he
added shrewdly. "Ven dot poy come here he
fooled himself!"</p>

<p>The last of the week saw Sandy&#8217;s return. He
came strolling along the trail one night just as the
sunlight was fading from the tops of the mountains.
He was whistling, apparently in high
spirits. Stopping at the door of Weimer&#8217;s shack
he paused to call:</p>

<p>"Hi, in there, Grant! I saw your friend
Leonard at Cody. I set you up in fine shape t&#8217;
&#8217;im. &#8217;No grass,&#8217; says I, &#8217;will turn t&#8217; hay while
he&#8217;s gittin&#8217; things done.&#8217;"</p>

<p>Ross laughed. Despite the fact that he knew
Sandy&#8217;s praise covered an abyss of insincerity, it
was pleasant, none the less.</p>

<p>After the supper dishes were washed, he decided
to visit the McKenzies. "Want to go along,
Uncle Weimer?" he asked, well knowing what the
reply would be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>"Go mit dem McKenzies?" gesticulated Weimer.
"Ven I do it vill pe ven my legs von&#8217;t carry me
avay from dem!"</p>

<p>Ross laughed. "Well, Uncle Weimer, my legs
seem to want to carry me where I can get the Cody
news. I want to hear about Mr. Leonard. Perhaps
he has heard from father more recently than I."</p>

<p>There was no moon that night, and the sky
had become suddenly overcast so that Ross faced a
dense darkness pierced only by the candle-light
from the window of the McKenzie shack. He
stumbled toward this, feeling his way so slowly
along the narrow trail that he unwittingly approached
the cabin silently and surprised an
altercation within. Sandy&#8217;s voice was raised in
vehement assertion and Waymart&#8217;s lower rumble
in protest. As he was groping for the door, he
heard Sandy say:</p>

<p>"I tell ye, Mart, wild hosses won&#8217;t drag &#8217;im up
here s&#8217; long as that young feller is in these mountings,
and we may want &#8217;im here."</p>

<p>Then Waymart&#8217;s response, "Well, what be ye
aimin&#8217; to do about it? Don&#8217;t bite off more&#8217;n ye
can swaller. Ye do that too often. He&#8217;ll be out
of here in a few weeks. What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; ye? &#8217;Let
well enough alone.&#8217;"</p>

<p>"Yes," scornfully from Sandy. "Ye maverick!
They won&#8217;t go till we<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>Ross, his hand on the door, had stubbed his toe
against a stone.</p>

<p>"Sh," came Sandy&#8217;s warning in lowered tones.
"What&#8217;s that?"</p>

<p>There was a step across the floor. Ross instinctively
fell back into the darkness and slipped
behind a tree. The door was jerked open and
Sandy&#8217;s figure appeared. An instant he looked
out and then turning back, said disgustedly, "Nobudy,
but guess we don&#8217;t need t&#8217; yell loud enough
t&#8217; be heard up t&#8217; Wilson&#8217;s."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ROSS&#8217;S "HIRED MAN"</span></h2>

<p>As the door closed on Sandy, Ross beat a hasty
retreat. His first thought was that the brothers
were discussing him. The fact that they were in
the valley to watch the progress of work on the
Weimer-Grant claims and that they were interested
in his being there and not anxious to have
him remain, all aided in the interpretation of the
McKenzies&#8217; speeches.</p>

<p>"But who on earth is it that won&#8217;t come as long
as I am here and why not?" he asked himself as
he stumbled back in the direction of the light in
Weimer&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>"Vat&#8217;s you pack for alreddy?" demanded
Weimer from his bunk as Ross opened the door.
"Ist dem McKenzies mit Wilson, hein?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Ross, "but I decided that I am
tired enough to turn in instead of going visiting,"
and he forthwith "turned in," but did not go to
sleep immediately.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, he was uneasy. He felt that
Sandy, behind that good-natured, friendly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
exterior, was full of schemes. The McKenzies
wanted the claims, and Ross had unexpectedly
interposed himself between them and their desires.
Therefore, their schemes must include him.
What was on foot now?</p>

<p>He tossed restlessly in his bunk assailed with
qualms of fear that he tried to conceal from himself.
"Ah, what you afraid of?" he asked himself
disgustedly. "They won&#8217;t shoot you nor yet
tie you hand and foot and throw you over the
Crosby trail. As Steele says, I haven&#8217;t a thing
to fear personally from &#8217;em. That&#8217;s not their
way. Go to sleep."</p>

<p>This command he issued to himself in an angry
mutter and at once scrambled up in his bunk wider
awake than ever. His mental horizon unexpectedly
cleared. "Of course he&#8217;s the one they meant
and not me!" he exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p>"Vat&#8217;s dat you say?" asked Weimer sleepily.
"Hein?"</p>

<p>"A waking nightmare," returned Ross and lay
down again.</p>

<p>Of course it was Leslie. "&#8217;He&#8217;s to be here only
a few weeks,&#8217;" Waymart had said. "&#8217;Let well
enough alone.&#8217;" He, Ross, expected to winter in
the valley, and the McKenzies knew it. Yes, they
were referring to Leslie. That calmed Ross, but
deepened the mystery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>The following morning he thought over the
situation while he was at work. It was a blind
enough situation, but he felt that he ought to repeat
to Leslie the scraps of conversation that he
had overheard. They might mean much to the
boy, and in spite of his reserve and his overbearing
manners Ross liked Leslie.</p>

<p>At noon he ate dinner hastily, and telling
Weimer that he would be back in an hour, set
out for the upper claims. Snow had fallen the
night before and the trail had filled, making walking
tiresome, for Ross had not yet accustomed himself
to the use of snow-shoes. With his hands in
his pockets and his cap drawn down over his eyes
he plunged through the drifts in the teeth of a
sharp east wind. Up the side of the mountains
he struggled, through the pass between two peaks
where Meadow Creek had cut a channel and into
a hollow sheltered from the wind and exposed to
the sun.</p>

<p>"Hello, Grant!" A voice greeted him from the
upper side of the trail.</p>

<p>Ross pushed his cap back and looked up. In
the sunshine, his back against a warm rock, his
feet buried in the dry loam and pine needles, sat
Leslie Jones. He had eaten his dinner and wandered
along the trail until he had found a warm
spot in which to spend the noon hour. Ross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
promptly climbed the steep mountainside and
dropped down beside him.</p>

<p>"The McKenzies say," began Leslie curiously,
"that you don&#8217;t stop work long enough to eat and
sleep. Yet here you are two miles from home in
the middle of the day."</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s because of what the McKenzies have said
that I&#8217;m here now," Ross returned swiftly. "It
may not be worth a picayune to you, and then
again, maybe, it will be," and he related the events
of the previous evening.</p>

<p>Leslie bent a troubled face over a stick that he
was idly whittling. "Are you sure, Grant, that
they meant me? I haven&#8217;t an idea who they are
nor who could be so afraid of me that he wouldn&#8217;t
come up here with me here. I don&#8217;t know of a
soul that&#8217;s afraid of me, but," with a short, mirthless
laugh, "I do know of some one that I&#8217;m afraid
of. It&#8217;s not the McKenzies, although they might&#8211;if
they know me<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Suddenly he flung the stick from him and
faced Ross impulsively. "Grant, did you ever do
something that you&#8217;d give anything you possessed
to undo&#8211;and that you&#8217;d just <i>got</i> to undo?"</p>

<p>Ross, startled at the sudden change in his companion,
at the latter&#8217;s intensity and evident unhappiness,
merely shook his head awkwardly,
avoiding the misery-filled eyes. He turned away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
and began piling up stones, bits of shining quartz
that had been thrown, at some time, out of a discovery
hole above them.</p>

<p>Presently Leslie regained his self-possession.
"I say, Grant," he began again abruptly, "to tell
you the truth, I have started to go over to see
you half a dozen times within a week and got
this far every time. I&#8217;m going to ask a favor of
you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ross with a gruffness that did
not conceal his sympathy. "Fire ahead!"</p>

<p>"The other day you&#8211;you offered me money,"
Leslie began with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I do to-day," Ross interrupted.</p>

<p>Leslie shook his head. "Hold on till I get to
it. I can&#8217;t take your money&#8211;not that way. But
the other day I heard the McKenzies tell Wilson
that you tried to hire men in Miners&#8217; Camp. Will
you hire me?"</p>

<p>"Will I!" Ross leaped to his feet. He grabbed
his cap and tossed it in the air and then fell to
pommeling Leslie in pure exuberance of joy.
"Hire you? I wish there were half a dozen of
you to hire! Bully for you! But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>His exuberance died out. He replaced his cap
and looked down on the other, his lips pursed
ready for a whistle.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>"See here!" Ross burst out. "What about
Wilson?"</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s all right," Leslie answered quickly.
"I told him a couple of days ago that I&#8217;d got to
get money. I told him I&#8217;d leave him the grub, of
course. I agreed to furnish it, and I&#8217;ll stick to my
word," doggedly, "but I must also light out and
earn some money. And all I can do is to work
with my hands. I&#8211;well, I&#8217;ve always hated to
make my head work, and I&#8217;ve never had to do
any other kind until now. You&#8217;ll find I&#8217;m soft
yet, but I&#8217;ll do my best."</p>

<p>The boy spoke humbly.</p>

<p>Ross sent his cap spinning into the air once
more. "I&#8217;ll risk you! You&#8217;re not as soft as you
were six weeks ago! Not by half! When can
you come?"</p>

<p>Leslie considered. "Wilson says he&#8217;ll go below
to the coal claims in a couple of weeks. I&#8217;ll talk
it over with him and let you know."</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow, if you can," Ross shouted
back as he slid down to the trail.</p>

<p>Work went easily for a few days in view of
Leslie&#8217;s coming. The thought of his companionship
robbed the prospective loneliness of Meadow
Creek Valley of its terrors. He whistled and sang
about the shack as he hunted up the material out
of which to make a third bunk. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
hammering away on this the second evening after his talk
with Leslie, when the McKenzies dropped in.
They had been over on the Divide hunting and
had been out of Ross&#8217;s sight and mind since his
talk with Leslie. Not until Sandy pushed the
door open unceremoniously and walked in did
Ross recall the comments that had so disturbed
him and wondered once more to whom they had
referred, himself or Leslie, and what the reference
meant.</p>

<p>"Hello, Grant!" Sandy exclaimed, stopping
abruptly just inside the door. "What&#8217;s up?
Why another bunk? Goin&#8217; t&#8217; take boarders?
Any relations droppin&#8217; in t&#8217; attend our festivities
up here?"</p>

<p>Ross looked over his shoulder laughingly.
"Nope. Give another guess."</p>

<p>Sandy came nearer. Waymart shut the door
and sat down beside the stove. Weimer turned
his back on "dem darned McKenzies," and put
on his goggles that he might not be tormented by
a view of their faces. It was a never-ending source
of vexation to him that they came sociably to his
shack.</p>

<p>"I haven&#8217;t any more guesses in stock," declared
Sandy, but the smile on his face was succeeded by
a frown and he bit his red beard restlessly.</p>

<p>"Hired man is coming to-morrow," Ross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
formed him as the hammer sent another nail home
in the side wall.</p>

<p>"Hired man!" exploded Sandy. "Where the
deuce will you get a hired man?"</p>

<p>"Right here in the valley," exulted Ross. "Leslie
Jones."</p>

<p>"Leslie Jones!" repeated Sandy.</p>

<p>"Leslie Jones," muttered Waymart.</p>

<p>"By and by," Ross confessed, "when all you
fellows go below, it will seem a little more livable
up here to have a third one around. I&#8217;d pay a
man wages just to stay here to say nothing of
working for me."</p>

<p>Neither Sandy nor Waymart made any comment.
Sandy stood watching the work in silence, while
Waymart allowed his pipe to go out. Then both
departed. They said they were going up to see
Wilson, but Ross noticed that they returned to
their own cabin instead.</p>

<p>"Something doesn&#8217;t seem to please our friends
the enemy," he chuckled after their departure.
"They see the Weimer-Grant claims getting further
and further from their reach."</p>

<p>"Ve vill peat dem McKenzies yet," gloated Weimer
rubbing his hands gently on his knees. "Ven
dot oder poy comes de work vill run und jump!"</p>

<p>Ross did not see the McKenzies again until
Leslie was occupying the third bunk, Wilson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
having, good-naturedly, sent him down within a week
after the boys had completed their bargain.</p>

<p>"Clear out if ye want to," Wilson had said
kindly. "It&#8217;s white of ye t&#8217; leave the grub. I
hain&#8217;t a cent t&#8217; pay fer it. There&#8217;s a fortune in
these claims of mine, but it&#8217;s too late t&#8217; dig it out
this year. Next summer<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" and he was launched
on the glowing prospects for the next season.</p>

<p>Leslie entered on his task with a grim determination
which seemed foreign to his disposition.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t want you to get sick of your bargain
the first week," he said one day in answer to
Ross&#8217;s remonstrance when he refused to stop work
on account of a bruise on his wrist. "You open
up that little emergency chest and I can go on digging
just the same. I don&#8217;t want any delayed
wages in mine!"</p>

<p>With the advent of Leslie, life fell into pleasanter
grooves in Weimer&#8217;s cabin. Despite the
anxiety ever present with the newcomer, and despite
his natural reserve, Ross&#8217;s exuberance of
spirits caused by his presence and work affected
him, and after the supper dishes were washed, the
two boys wrestled, chaffed each other or talked,
Ross about his father and uncle and aunt, Leslie
about his school life in Omaha.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s a boys&#8217; school," he explained one day, "a
military academy. I&#8217;ve had to go there ever since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
I was knee high to a grasshopper. Discipline is
fierce. I hate it, and this year I made up my
mind I&#8217;d not stand it, so I&#8217;m here."</p>

<p>"And wish," ventured Ross, "that you were
back in school again."</p>

<p>"Yes&#8211;almost," Leslie began impulsively and
then paused, adding quietly, "Lots of things I
wish, and wish &#8217;em hard."</p>

<p>The following evening after supper, Weimer
tumbled into his bunk at once and began snoring.
The two boys washed the dishes, in silence at first.
Outside, snow was falling heavily. Through the
drifting flakes the McKenzies&#8217; light shone fitfully.
The brothers had been away again hunting and
had just returned.</p>

<p>As Leslie set the dishes on their shelf above the
stove he glanced uneasily out of the window. He
had not seen the McKenzies for some time. Ever
since they had crossed the valley that noon on
their snow-shoes, their hunting trophies on their
shoulders, he had watched their cabin with that
same air of uneasy abstraction.</p>

<p>"Ross," he broke out at last, "I&#8217;ve got to tell
you something. I hate like a dog to tell it, but
it&#8217;s got to break loose some time and it may as well
be right now."</p>

<p>He turned from the shelf, glanced at the snoring
Weimer, lowered his voice, and, standing beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
the stove, worked restlessly at the damper in
the pipe. Ross, without looking at him, slowly
scrubbed the dish-pan and then the table.</p>

<p> "It&#8217;s like this," Leslie began. "When I met
Wilson I had five hundred dollars in my pocket
and a grouch against my father. Always before
then, father had sent the Academy a check to pay
for the semester&#8211;you have to pay there in advance
for half the year&#8211;but this year he had business on
hand that couldn&#8217;t be interrupted and so he called
me into his office in a great hurry the morning I
left home and handed over the check to me. It
was made out to me and it was for five hundred
dollars. That&#8217;s the price of the half year, you see.
Dad handed it over and just said, &#8217;Here, pay your
own bill,&#8217; and got out. That&#8217;s about all that&#8217;s
ever between us, anyway. Well, I went up to
Omaha. We&#8217;d had it out about school all summer.
I was bound not to go this year, and he swore that
I should go and go through college if he had to
rope me and tie me and take me himself, as he put
it! Father is a whirlwind of a man. But I was
bound not to go, and the money let me out. I
took the check and cashed it at the bank and went
to the &#8217;Hill House,&#8217; where I met Wilson. I reasoned
that the money was mine because it was to
be spent on me. You see, Ross, I was mad enough
to reason anything my way that I wanted."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>Leslie turned the damper absently, sending
smoke in gusts into the room, but neither boy noticed
it. Ross wiped out his dish-pan, hung it on
its nail, and sitting down on a box, took his chin
between his hands and stared at the fire.</p>

<p>"I thought," Leslie went on, "that I&#8217;d invest
that money and surprise dad. Well," grimly,
"he&#8217;s probably as surprised by this time as I am.
You&#8217;ve heard Wilson tell about my meeting him
and agreeing to go with him. I spent the entire
five hundred on our outfit and car-fare in the expectation
that in six weeks I could write to dad
and tell him what a success I&#8217;d made of it! I had
six weeks&#8217; grace."</p>

<p>Ross looked up inquiringly. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Father and I never have corresponded extensively,
but he always looks sharply after my reports.
The first report goes out from the Academy
in six weeks after school opens. I reckoned from
what Wilson said that we&#8217;d strike it rich up here
in a month more or less, and so about the time
father would be looking into the reason why no
report was sent from the Academy, he&#8217;d be receiving
one from me up here and, you know, Ross,
&#8217;nothing succeeds as well as success,&#8217; and success
of this sort would get dad right under the collar.
Well, he probably knows by this time that I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
turned up missing at school, and he has not received
a letter from Meadow Creek telling about
the discovery of free gold!"</p>

<p>Leslie gave the damper a final twist and sat
down on a pile of fire-wood. "Ross," he exclaimed
violently, "I am about seven ways an everlasting
fool!"</p>

<p>Ross grinned cheerfully. "Aunt Anne always
says that to find out that you&#8217;re a fool &#8217;is the best
cure for the disease of foolishness.&#8217; So you see
you&#8217;re headed toward the cure already."</p>

<p>Leslie shook his head. "There&#8217;s that money,
Ross. It wasn&#8217;t mine, and you know it and I
know it. I can&#8217;t face dad again without it in my
hand. Why, I wouldn&#8217;t see him until I&#8217;d earned
it for&#8211;well, wild horses wouldn&#8217;t drag me," he
concluded passionately. "I tell you, Ross, I&#8217;ve let
myself in for a heap of trouble. I know father."</p>

<p>"Now that he finds out you&#8217;ve skipped, Leslie,
won&#8217;t he be hunting you up?"</p>

<p>Leslie stirred uneasily and turning stretched up
and looked in the direction of the McKenzies.
"That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m expecting, or else he&#8217;ll not think
me worth while. I tell you, Ross, I&#8217;ve made dad
no end of trouble both at home and in school.
Things look sort of different up here. I&#8217;ve&#8211;well&#8211;I&#8217;ve
never been up against it before."</p>

<p>"Are you going to send your father word?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>"Send him word before I get back that five
hundred!" cried Leslie aghast. "You don&#8217;t know
dad. I can&#8217;t face him without it. Not much."</p>

<p>"But he&#8217;d see that you feel different<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" Ross
began.</p>

<p>"You don&#8217;t know dad," Leslie cut in harshly.
"With the men it&#8217;s just the same. It&#8217;s &#8217;stand and
deliver&#8217; or get out, and he&#8217;d treat me just the
same."</p>

<p>The coming of the McKenzies put an end to
further conversation. They came to announce
their departure on the morrow.</p>

<p>"Any little thing you&#8217;d like us t&#8217; git fer you?"
Sandy asked the boys lazily. "Want us t&#8217; bring
ye any biled shirts or one of these here coats with
long handled tails? If you fellers lay out t&#8217; stay
here all winter ye better lay in a stock of society
rags, &#8217;n&#8217; dancin&#8217; shoes."</p>

<p>"About the most useful dancing shoes we&#8217;ll need
will be snow-shoes, I guess," Ross retorted.</p>

<p>Leslie, from the wood-pile, said little but watched
the brothers closely. Neither paid more than a
passing attention to him, concentrating their remarks
on Ross. They left early and went up the
Creek with the intention of paying a farewell call
on Wilson.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t believe," said Leslie the following
morning as he watched them take the trail leading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
over Crosby, "that they have ever seen me before.
They don&#8217;t act as though they have, do they?"</p>

<p>"Haven&#8217;t seen a sign of it since that first
night," declared Ross, "and yet what I overheard,
you know<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Must have referred to you," returned Leslie
with conviction.</p>

<p>The next three days passed quietly enough.
The inhabitants of Weimer&#8217;s cabin heard an
occasional blast from Wilson&#8217;s claims, but did not
see Wilson. Steadily the two boys worked and
steadily Ross held Weimer to his labors. Usually
it was Weimer who got the meals, either Ross or
Leslie leading him down to the shack, in case the
sun shone, about half-past eleven. In three-quarters
of an hour the boys would leave work
and sit down to a substantial meal of hot bread,
potatoes and all sorts of canned meats and vegetables.
But the third day after the McKenzies&#8217;
departure it chanced that when eleven o&#8217;clock
came, Weimer and Leslie were in the far end of
the tunnel drilling the "cut in" holes for a new
blast, and Ross, pushing the little car back into
the tunnel, sang out:</p>

<p>"Hey, you fellows, keep on and I&#8217;ll go down
and shake up the grub this time."</p>

<p>He ran down the trail to the cabin, and soon
had a roaring fire in the heater. A kettle of beans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
had been left simmering on the back of the stove.
This Ross pulled forward, and then, delving
among the canned goods, he proceeded to set out
various edibles, all the while whistling cheerfully.</p>

<p>"M-m, tomatoes," he interrupted himself to
mutter, "we haven&#8217;t had tomatoes in two days.
And corn&#8211;sweet corn. Guess Weimer has overlooked
the corn entirely. We&#8217;ll have corn. Soup!
Jiminy! We haven&#8217;t had soup in an age. Vegetable.
That means a little of everything, and that
taken boiling hot. Here goes soup."</p>

<p>"Whoa!" came a deep voice from the trail outside
the door, then the voice was raised, "Hello!
Who&#8217;s t&#8217; home?"</p>

<p>Ross stepped to the door and faced a middle
aged man, clad in leather "chaps" and short fur
coat. A fur cap was drawn down over his ears
and his hands were encased in huge fur gloves.
He sat easily on a gray horse and was leading
another, a mottled brown and white. As Ross
appeared, he drew off one glove and slipped the
hand carelessly under the tail of his coat at the
same time squaring about in his saddle so that he
faced the doorway.</p>

<p>Ross, in his shirt sleeves, stepped out and
greeted the newcomer hospitably. "Hello! Come
in to dinner."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>"Had mine down in Miners&#8217; Camp," returned
the other with a backward jerk of his head.</p>

<p>He touched his mount with his spur and came
close to Ross. The brown and white horse pulled
back obstinately on the leading rope. The animal
was saddled.</p>

<p>"Are you the young chap that&#8217;s workin&#8217; for
Weimer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right." The stranger withdrew his hand
from the tail of his coat. It held a gun. "No
monkey-shines now! You&#8217;re the boy I&#8217;m after.
I&#8217;m the sheriff of Big Horn County, and I have a
warrant here for your arrest. Your father is
honin&#8217; to meet up with you and settle a little
account of money taken in Omaha."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>SURPRISES</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> a moment Ross was stunned. His hands
fell nervelessly at his side, and he stared up at the
stranger with expressionless eyes. Then, as the
situation dawned on him, his eyes suddenly narrowed
and into them leaped a light that caused
the other to move the gun suggestively and say
warningly:</p>

<p>"No monkeying allowed, understand. Swallow
a bite right now and climb up here on this other
horse."</p>

<p>Ross looked over his shoulder speculatively.
From his position he could see the mouth of the
tunnel on the mountainside behind the cabin.
The mouth showed up black and empty and from
its depth came the muffled sound of the hand
drills wielded by Weimer and Leslie. The trail
leading over the mountain to Miners&#8217; Camp was
screened from the mouth of the tunnel by hemlocks.
It could be seen only from the end of the
dump. Ross thought fast.</p>

<p>"All right," he said finally. "I&#8217;ll go with you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
now&#8211;and quietly. There&#8217;s no objection, I suppose,
to my leaving a note for&#8211;Weimer?"</p>

<p>No doubt existed in his mind as to the legality
of the warrant and the seriousness of purpose in
the man before him; therefore, he asked no further
questions. Moreover, he wished above all things
to avoid question and get off before Leslie appeared
on the scene.</p>

<p>"Leave a note, yes, or see &#8217;im," assented the
sheriff. "I&#8217;m willin&#8217;. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At work," hastily. "I&#8217;ll just leave a note."</p>

<p>The sheriff dismounted, dropped his bridle reins
beside his horse&#8217;s head, hitched the second animal&#8217;s
rope about the pommel of his saddle, and
followed Ross into the shack, repeating, "Where
at work?"</p>

<p>"In the tunnel," mumbled Ross. "I would
rather write a line than call him."</p>

<p>He picked up some cold biscuits left over from
breakfast and stuffed them into his pockets. Then,
drawing a box up to the table, he sat down with
paper and pencil to write a note. To his confusion,
the sheriff stood over him looking on. He
moistened the point of his pencil slowly. What
on earth could he say that would make Leslie
understand and yet not give the situation away to
the sheriff? To gain time he gnawed on one of
Weimer&#8217;s hard biscuits.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>"Where is my&#8211;father?" he asked finally,
stumbling guiltily over the word.</p>

<p>The sheriff spat out of the doorway and twirled
his gun impatiently. "You&#8217;ll see &#8217;im before I
leave you, all right," was his ambiguous reply.
"And the sooner that is the better it&#8217;ll suit me.
Git busy, young man, with that pencil. I don&#8217;t
aim to go int&#8217; winter quarters here. We&#8217;ve got
to go on to Cody."</p>

<p>Ross bit his lips and laid the biscuit aside. His
eyes narrowed until they were mere slits. Grasping
his pencil with a firmness he was far from
feeling he began to write without preface.</p>

<p>"The sheriff is here arresting me for stealing
money from my father in Omaha. He is taking
me to him in Cody now. I don&#8217;t know when I
can get back. Keep the work going sure, and
don&#8217;t worry. I think I will be able<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>He paused and moistened the pencil again, then
crossed out the last sentence and substituted:</p>

<p>"I shall try to reason with him and make him
see that he had better let me keep on doing what I
am doing and earn the money to pay him back."</p>

<p>Another instant Ross paused and thought.
Then he added the singular explanation which
he believed would make the foregoing more
lucid to Leslie:</p>

<p>"As I write the sheriff is standing over me,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
and then bethought himself just in time to avoid
signing his name.</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted the sheriff reading the last
sentence. "So he is; and now hustle!"</p>

<p>Ross hustled most willingly. Seizing his top-coat
and cap he was ready in a few moments for
the perilous journey over the Crosby trail. Silently
he mounted the brown and white horse, all the
time glancing anxiously at the mouth of the
tunnel. He rode in front of the sheriff and
slyly urged his horse forward until the intervening
trees hid the mouth of the tunnel from
which still issued the steady grind and thud of
the drills.</p>

<p>It was not until the two horses were cautiously
feeling their way down the perilous trail, and Ross
saw far below him the shacks of Miners&#8217; Camp that
some of the difficulties of his sudden venture began
to present themselves to him. His decision had
been made so hurriedly that he had had no time
to think all around the subject of the arrest and
his own action. It had seemed to him outrageous
that a father should arrest his own son even though
that boy had done wrong. Ross revolted at the
idea.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t wonder," he thought, "that Less is
afraid of his father. But his fear wouldn&#8217;t sit
so hard on his temper but what there&#8217;d be no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
end of explosions, and then where would they
both get to?"</p>

<p>It was the thought of this state of affairs that
had led Ross to the impulsive determination to
go to that father and ask for a few months of
grace for the son. In this, as he acknowledged to
himself, he had a mixed motive and part of the
mixture was not unselfish.</p>

<p>"If he&#8217;ll only let Leslie stay and help me
through the winter and earn the money," was
his thought, "if I can make him see that Leslie&#8217;s
no quitter, and that he knows he has made a big
mistake and is willing to bone down and undo it&#8211;if
I can only make him see!"</p>

<p>It was here that Ross&#8217;s misgivings began. He
knew he was no talker and evidently, as Leslie
said, the father was a man of violent temper.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ll probably have my little trip under arrest
for nothing," Ross told himself as they reached
the foot of Crosby. "Mr. Jones will blow my
head off and send back for Leslie. Queer father
not to come himself instead of sending a sheriff
and a warrant and so disgrace his own son!"</p>

<p>As to who was responsible for notifying the
father of the whereabouts of his son, Ross did
not for a moment doubt. Sandy&#8217;s trip to Cody
and the departure a few days before of both
brothers answered that question to his satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>At the foot of Crosby the trail of horsemen
turned into the wagon trail leading past Gale&#8217;s
Ridge. On foot approaching them was a man
whom Ross had met often in Steele&#8217;s shack, and
the sight of him awoke the boy with a shock to
another phase of the situation that he had not, so
far, had time to consider. Of course, it would not
be possible for him to reach Cody and Mr. Jones
without betraying his identity to the sheriff!
There were the men of Gale&#8217;s Ridge, the hotel at
Meeteetse, and above all, there was Sagehen Roost
and Hank. He turned in his saddle. It was a
waste of time to go on. He might as well own up
and let the sheriff go back after Leslie.</p>

<p>"I was foolish to think of coming!" he muttered
aloud and reined in his horse.</p>

<p>The sheriff, coming on behind with his head
bent, looked up questioningly and rode alongside.
The two had not exchanged a word since leaving
the Creek, the sheriff being silent by nature and
Ross by choice. At that instant, the footman
passed them. On the sheriff he bestowed an
unrecognizing nod, on Ross a broad and cordial
grin.</p>

<p>"Hello, there, Doc!" he greeted and passed on.</p>

<p>The sheriff glanced in surprise from the man to
Ross. The latter drew a deep breath, and squaring
about on his saddle shook the bridle reins. "That&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
a nickname they&#8217;ve given me," he muttered and
rode on.</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded and fell back, leaving Ross
determined to play the game as far as he was able.
He had forgotten that he was known from Cody to
Meeteetse as "Doc Tenderfoot." In a few moments
they had passed through camp and, rounding the
shoulder of old Dundee, settled down to the
eighteen mile ride to the half-way house between
Miners&#8217; Camp and Meeteetse. This house, as Ross
knew, had changed hands since his arrival in the
mountains, and the change would lessen the
chances that he would be recognized there. As it
turned out, the sheriff was not recognized either,
the family being newcomers in Wyoming, and the
two ate in silence, the sheriff introducing neither
himself nor Ross.</p>

<p>"Luck is with me so far," Ross thought as they
saddled and rode away from the ranch, "but how
can I ever get past Meeteetse and Sagehen Roost?"</p>

<p>The moon shone brilliantly, and they pushed
ahead rapidly, Ross exulting over the sheriff&#8217;s
determination to get on to Meeteetse that night.
They rode as silently as before, Ross in advance.
The black hills met the trail on either side, and
beside the trail flowed the shallow waters of Wood
River until it merged into the Grey Bull. Half-way
to Meeteetse, the sheriff&#8217;s horse stumbled and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
limped thereafter, necessitating a slower pace, so
that it was nearly midnight before they drew rein
in front of the "Weller House."</p>

<p>To Ross&#8217;s relief, the place was dark with the exception
of a single lamp in the office. Even the
barroom was deserted. Ross left the sheriff to
register for both, and then followed the sleepy
clerk down to a lunch of cold "come-backs"
which that individual "rustled" from the kitchen
himself.</p>

<p>"If fortune will favor me as well to-morrow as
it did to-day," Ross thought as he listened to the
sheriff&#8217;s first snores, "I&#8217;ll be next to Jones by this
time to-morrow night and try to do some talking
for Leslie!"</p>

<p>He knew that his roommate was no wiser concerning
him than when they started from Meadow
Creek, and he most heartily desired a continuation
of that ignorance.</p>

<p>In the morning the two were up early and down
to breakfast. Ross looked about apprehensively
for some one who had seen him on his way into
the mountains. He slunk into the dining-room
in the wake of the bulkier sheriff and pushing
himself unobtrusively into a corner seat bent low
over his plate as befitted a young man under
arrest. But no sooner was he seated than the
proprietor of the house spied him from the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
end of the dining-room, and with never a suspicion
that he was talking to the sheriff&#8217;s prisoner, strode
across the room. He slapped the sheriff familiarly
on the shoulder:</p>

<p>"What the dickens are you doing up this way?
Why don&#8217;t ye stay in Basin where ye belong?"</p>

<p>Then he grasped Ross&#8217;s hand cordially:</p>

<p>"Bless us if here ain&#8217;t Doc back again. Got
them claims cleaned up yet, Doc?"</p>

<p>Ross, encountering the puzzled eyes of the sheriff,
quaked. "No, we haven&#8217;t yet," he muttered and
glancing toward the dining-room door, exclaimed
in sudden inspiration, "Wonder if that man is
motioning to you?"</p>

<p>The proprietor looked around. Several men
were in the hall outside the dining-room. "I&#8217;ll
go and see," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The sheriff continued to look at Ross. "Bluff!"
he announced briefly and understandingly.</p>

<p>The blood flooded Ross&#8217;s face guiltily. "It
was," he confessed, adding quickly, "Say, don&#8217;t
give my arrest away where I&#8217;m known, will
you?"</p>

<p>His request and confusion satisfied the sheriff.
The puzzled expression died out of his face. "All
right," he assented and fell on his breakfast.</p>

<p>The proprietor did not see Ross again until he
was riding away. Then he ran out of the barroom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
bareheaded and called, "Steele&#8217;s in Cody, Doc. He
said you was pannin&#8217; out more like an old prospector
than a tenderfoot."</p>

<p>The sheriff rode up beside his prisoner with a
quick inquiry: "How long have ye worked for
Weimer?"</p>

<p>"Long enough to be sick of it and want to quit,"
returned Ross gruffly, giving his horse a quick
slap that set the animal to loping. It was no part
of his plan to hold any unnecessary conversation
with the sheriff that day.</p>

<p>"I guess," the latter called as he came galloping
after, "that you&#8217;ll quit now all right, all
right!"</p>

<p>Ross made no reply, but took care to keep well
in advance of his captor. Although his plan had,
so far, succeeded, he was far from feeling triumphant
because of a distressing sense of guilt at the
deception he was obliged to practice. Nor was he
able to dispel this sense by the knowledge that he
was acting for the good of all concerned.</p>

<p>"I may be only messing things up more than
they are already," he thought dejectedly as they
approached Sagehen Roost. "What under the
sun led me to think I was equal to such a job,
anyway?"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, his eyes narrowed, his chin
raised itself determinedly and he turned his attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
to the half-way house and the loquacious
Hank. How could he ever get past Hank and remain
Leslie Jones in the sheriff&#8217;s eyes? If only he
could get a moment&#8217;s speech with Hank alone.
But the sheriff was ever at his elbow. They had
made good time from Meeteetse, and so approached
Dry Creek and Sagehen Roost a full hour ahead of
the stage from Cody. This fact gave Ross courage.
With the stage-driver eliminated he had
only Hank to deal with.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hank!" shouted the sheriff as they
dismounted in front of the corral. "Shake us up
some grub right away, will ye?"</p>

<p>Hank appeared at the door. Ross dodged behind
the sheriff&#8217;s horse, and stooping over noted
the approach of Hank&#8217;s legs. When they had
borne their owner to the corral gate he straightened
up and saying loudly: "Hello, Hank!" scratched
the flank of the horse sharply with a pin he had
found under the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p>"Wall, if there ain&#8217;t Doc Tenderfoot!" shouted
Hank, but got no further.</p>

<p>The horse leaped forward, and, as the sheriff
sprang for its head, Ross managed to get Hank&#8217;s
ear for an instant:</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t give me away, Hank. Talk to him
and let me alone&#8211;understand&#8211;no names called.
Don&#8217;t talk to me nor about me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>Hank stared his amazement, helped the sheriff
catch his mount, scratched his head until Ross&#8217;s
words had soaked in, and then obeyed them so
literally that when, half an hour later, Ross leaped
to his horse&#8217;s back, he was still Leslie Jones to the
taciturn sheriff, and Hank, tongue-tied for once,
was left standing beside the corral gate with a
multitude of questions unasked.</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s spirits arose. They were on the home
stretch now to Cody. There was not a house on
the way and only the stage to meet. Ross, forgetting
his rôle as a shamefaced prisoner, began to
whistle and plan what he should say to Leslie&#8217;s
father. His buoyancy was checked only when he
chanced to look over his shoulder and discovered
the sheriff looking at him not only with the puzzled
air which he had worn at Meeteetse, but, Ross
thought, with suspicion also.</p>

<p>"I never seen a sober man arrested that took
arrest as you do," the sheriff declared riding to
Ross&#8217;s side. "Think this is a little picnic, don&#8217;t
ye?"</p>

<p>"I&#8217;m trying to think just how it will turn out,"
answered the boy seriously. "There&#8217;s the Cody
stage, isn&#8217;t it?"</p>

<p>The sheriff reined his horse back, and, with a
flourish, the four horses swept past with Andy&#8217;s
foot jammed hard on the brake and Andy&#8217;s whip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
cracking over the wheelers&#8217; heads. Just in the
nick of time he recognized Ross.</p>

<p>"Hi, there!" he shouted. "Doc, where&#8217;s yer
patient? And how is he?"</p>

<p>Then, before any answer could be returned, the
stage was beyond reach of Ross&#8217;s voice, disappearing
in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"What patient does he mean?" asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s a fellow I helped when I first came out
here," answered Ross frankly. He was afraid of
the sheriff&#8217;s suspicions. "He was hurt in front of
Sagehen Roost, and as I know something about
surgery I&#8211;helped&#8211;to fix him up."</p>

<p>The sheriff studied his horse&#8217;s ears. A look of
perplexity overspread his face. "I heard of that
down in Basin. But it seems to me that was before
you come." He looked hard at Ross. "The
McKenzies said<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" He stopped suddenly, and
bit his lips.</p>

<p>Ross seized this pause to mutter, "It&#8217;s not so
long ago," and forged ahead on the trail, taking
good care to keep ahead until the lights of Cody
and the odor of the Shoshone River&#8211;"Stinking
Water"&#8211;smote their senses together through the
gathering darkness of the early December night.
Then the sheriff, straightening in his saddle, said
in a voice of authority:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>"Come back here. We&#8217;ll ride neck and neck
now."</p>

<p>Ross fell back, and asked his first question, and
no sooner was it out than he bit his lips savagely
in vexation at his own thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Jones stopping at &#8217;The Irma&#8217;?"</p>

<p>"Who?" exploded the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones," murmured Ross in confusion.</p>

<p>The sheriff looked the boy over silently but intently
in the moonlight. The blood surged into
Ross&#8217;s face, and, despite the chill of the night wind,
the perspiration broke out on his forehead.</p>

<p>"Huh!" was the only response to his question.
"Jones!"</p>

<p>Then, with their horses neck to neck the two
rode over the bridge together and for the second
time entered the town to which Buffalo Bill has
given his name, Cody. On the other side of the
bridge, near the dust-deep road, stood a tent. The
flap was fastened back, and, within, seated about a
rough table, sat four men playing cards. When
the sound of horses&#8217; hoofs reached the players, one
of them arose and came to the tent&#8217;s opening.</p>

<p>It was Sandy McKenzie.</p>

<p>The sheriff, still regarding Ross, did not look
toward the tent, while Ross, excited over the prospect
of meeting Leslie&#8217;s father, and confused by his
recent misspeech, scarcely bestowed a moment&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
thought on Sandy, whom he had known was in
Cody and believed to be the instigator of the arrest.
He glanced, however, within the tent as they passed
and recognized Waymart. The man sitting next,
his back to the open flap, his face bent over the
cards in his hand, one leg stretched out under the
table, looked strangely familiar to the boy, but he
was too preoccupied to give him any attention.
The fourth man, his face turned toward the riders,
was a stranger.</p>

<p>A moment later, a man took the horses in front
of "The Irma," and the sheriff with his prisoner
walked into the lobby and up to the desk. Picking
up the pen, the sheriff thrust it into Ross&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>"Register for yourself," he commanded briefly.</p>

<p>Ross hesitated, glanced at the waiting clerk,
glanced at the suspicious face of the sheriff and
then, with a shaking hand, wrote: "Ross Grant,
Junior," and laid the pen down.</p>

<p>The sheriff drew the register toward him with a
slowly purpling face.</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s my name," declared Ross. He spoke
defensively, yet with a ring of exultation in his
voice. "You haven&#8217;t asked me for it before."</p>

<p>The blood dropped out of the sheriff&#8217;s face. The
shivers ran down Ross&#8217;s spine at the anger in his
face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>"What does this mean, you cub!" the sheriff
demanded furiously.</p>

<p>"It means that I want to talk to Leslie Jones&#8217;
father before he sees Leslie," announced Ross
boldly, "so I came with you. There was nothing
to prevent my coming."</p>

<p>A hand fell on the sheriff&#8217;s shoulder. Sandy
McKenzie stood at Ross&#8217;s elbow. Sandy&#8217;s face
wore a curiously baffled expression, but he
nodded to Ross in much his usual nonchalant
manner.</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc, you here? Didn&#8217;t expect to see
you. How&#8217;d you leave Leslie Jones?"</p>

<p>There was an emphasis on the last name which
Ross did not notice. Neither did he notice the
shrewd observation in the questioner&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>"I left him busy," the boy returned glibly, "and
so did the sheriff!"</p>

<p>Once more the blood rushed into the sheriff&#8217;s
face, and in unselected language he had begun to
tell Ross what he thought of him, when Sandy
succeeded in drawing him aside and leading him
into the barroom, followed by Waymart and a
group that the conversation had attracted.</p>

<p>After they had disappeared, Ross turned to the
clerk. "Is Mr. Jones stopping here?" he asked
confidently.</p>

<p>"Nope," responded the clerk, leaning an elbow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
on the ledger. "What was it you put over the
sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Not here!" Ross exclaimed, not hearing the
question. "Did you understand the name? I
want to see Mr. Jones." In his anxiety he raised
his voice.</p>

<p>The clerk grinned. "There ain&#8217;t no man here
by the name of Jones."</p>

<p>"But there must be," Ross insisted stupidly.
"There&#8217;s got to be! This is the only hotel in
town, isn&#8217;t it?"</p>

<p>"Yep," grinned the clerk. "It&#8217;s the original
Waldorf-Astory all right. Where does this here
Jones hail from?"</p>

<p>"Omaha." There was unlimited dismay in
Ross&#8217;s tone.</p>

<p>"Hain&#8217;t got any one from Omaha here, and
hain&#8217;t had this winter."</p>

<p>Ross pulled the register toward him and began
to scan the names. Instantly he exclaimed,
"Bully! Steele. I&#8217;d forgotten him. I&#8217;ll see<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Not this trip!" the clerk interrupted lazily.
"Ye must &#8217;a&#8217; met Steele. He went back on the
stage to-night."</p>

<p>"Leonard, then. He&#8217;s here, isn&#8217;t he?"</p>

<p>"Nope," replied the clerk nonchalantly. "He&#8217;s
in Basin. Home&#8217;s there, ye know."</p>

<p>Baffled, perplexed, Ross turned again to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
register. The clerk had told the truth. There
had been no guest entered from Omaha or any
place further away than Montana in weeks. "See
here," he exclaimed finally, "do you know anything
about Leslie Jones, that went over to
Meadow Creek with a man named Wilson a few
weeks ago?"</p>

<p>The clerk leisurely turned the pages until he
arrived at the entry sought. "Here they be,"
he pushed the book across the counter. "Wilson
and Jones. They stayed here most a week.
Knew Wilson and remember Jones when he
was here."</p>

<p>"And hasn&#8217;t his father been here?" asked Ross
eagerly. "Not at any time?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Haven&#8217;t you&#8211;haven&#8217;t you heard from him at
any time or&#8211;or known about him? I&#8217;ve got to
see the father," Ross burst out in irrepressible
confidence born of his distraction. "I&#8217;ve stopped
work and come all the way down from the Shoshones
to talk with Jones."</p>

<p>"Can&#8217;t help it. Don&#8217;t know anything about
any Jones except this young one."</p>

<p>At this point the clerk was called into the
dining-room. He left Ross standing beside the
desk staring at the register, confused and helpless.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>"And right here I got the big head over the
way I had managed," he told himself in humiliation,
"and at the very last minute gave the whole
thing away!"</p>

<p>Why couldn&#8217;t he have had the sense to play the
game far enough to see the end&#8211;and Leslie&#8217;s
father, he asked himself miserably. Now he had
simply made a fool of himself and angered the
sheriff and had not benefited Leslie. The sheriff
would probably turn about and go back after the
right boy. With this thought Ross straightened
his shoulders determinedly and turned toward the
barroom. As there was nothing to be gained by
silence he was going to ask questions. As he
turned, a man slid into the hotel in advance of
him&#8211;the man with the oddly familiar back.</p>

<p>The sheriff, Sandy and Waymart were standing
together, and toward them Ross made his way
through clouds of tobacco smoke and past groups
of cowboys, railroad men and prospectors.</p>

<p>"Hi, Doc!" called Sandy gaily. "Hump along
here and be sociable. What&#8217;ll you have? It&#8217;s on
me. Anybody," admiringly, "that&#8217;s smart enough
t&#8217; fool the sheriff of Big Horn County can have
anything on me they&#8217;ll take."</p>

<p>The sheriff turned his back on Sandy and
scowled. He did not glance at his late prisoner.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t want anything," declared Ross shortly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
He planted himself resolutely in front of Sandy.
"But I&#8217;d like to know where Leslie Jones&#8217; father
is?"</p>

<p>Sandy smiled easily, while the scowl faded from
the sheriff&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>"I ain&#8217;t no city directory, Doc," responded
Sandy, "and what&#8217;s more, I ain&#8217;t knowin&#8217; of
any Leslie Jones! His end name ain&#8217;t any more
Jones than yours is. He&#8217;s fooled ye mighty bad&#8211;see?"</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Ross&#8217;s face. "N-not
Jones?" he stammered. "Not Jones! What is
it then?"</p>

<p>"Why, Doc, if he don&#8217;t want ye t&#8217; know I ain&#8217;t
got a call t&#8217; tell ye. Be reasonable." Sandy spoke
with maddening pleasantry and condescension.
"A feller&#8217;s name is his own, and if he wants t&#8217;
keep it kinda fresh and unused I ain&#8217;t the one t&#8217;
dig it up &#8217;n&#8217; let it get covered with dust. Better
go back t&#8217; Meadow Creek and have it out with
Leslie."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Ross, with a hot and angry
face, was back in the lobby. His indignation
burned against Leslie, who had, unconsciously,
helped to put him in the hole in which he found
himself. The subdued laugh which had marked
his retreat from the barroom rang long in his
ears. The sheriff&#8217;s laugh was the loudest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>"Arrest will serve him right!" muttered Ross
as he entered the dining-room. "There isn&#8217;t a
reason on earth why he shouldn&#8217;t have told me
his right name when he told me the rest."</p>

<p>Angrily Ross ate his supper, glowering down at
his plate and not noticing the entrance of the
McKenzies with the sheriff.</p>

<p>After supper he went up to his room. The door
was unlocked, the key having been long since lost.
A single electric bulb swinging over the dresser
was alight. Under the bulb lay a sealed and
soiled envelope. Ross picked it up and turning
it over came on the direction, "Doc Tenderfoot,"
in a sprawling and carefully careless hand. Wonderingly
he opened the envelope. Within was a
note written with a lead pencil on the back of a
yellow advertising sheet. It ran:</p>

<p>"Leslie&#8217;s name is Quinn, not Jones. His father
is A. B. Quinn, North Bend, Okla., or 14 Castle
Street, Omaha. He is in Omaha now waiting
for Leslie. Sheriff is to send him there. Mum is
the word about this note&#8211;to him or Leslie or the
McKenzies. If I did not know you were on the
square you would not get it to be mum about."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEWCOMER ON MEADOW CREEK</span></h2>

<p>"&#8217;<span class='sc'>Old</span> man Quinn!&#8217;" Ross cried aloud.
"&#8217;Old man Quinn&#8217; and the sheep war. And
Leslie is his son!"</p>

<p>It all came back, the story he had almost forgotten
in the stress of events on Meadow Creek,
the conversation on the train, old Sheepy&#8217;s tale
and, at last, his suspicions concerning Lon Weston
with his dyed hair. And when his memory
brought Lon into mental view, Ross&#8217;s face lit up
with a sudden flash of intelligence.</p>

<p>"It was Weston that I saw in the tent, and it
was Weston that went into the barroom ahead of
me!"</p>

<p>He laid the note on the dresser and, bending
under the electric light, studied it. There was
nothing to show who had written it except the
caution at the end. That might have emanated
from Waymart, but the language was better than
he would have used. Ross felt that it was Lon
Weston who had written that message. Of course,
if such was the case, and Lon was the fourth whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
old man Quinn was looking for, that warning not
to give the unsigned writer away would be accounted
for. It might, in some way, be the clew
that would lead to Lon&#8217;s detection. Ross now recalled
how Lon had lain with one arm over his
face all the time that Wilson and Leslie had been
at the stage camp. He could not now recall
whether or not the injured man&#8217;s name had been
spoken in Leslie&#8217;s presence. But he did remember
that Leslie had said of the McKenzies that perhaps
they were men at some time in his father&#8217;s employ,
in which case he might not know them, but that
they would probably recognize him.</p>

<p>"Then if he had heard Weston&#8217;s name it might
not mean anything to Leslie," Ross concluded.</p>

<p>He wondered why Lon had not made himself
known that evening and wondered how he came to
know the McKenzies. In fact, he sat on the side
of his bed wondering about a dozen things until
midnight, and then went to bed undecided what
to do now that he had Quinn&#8217;s address in his
possession. His resentment kindled against Leslie
whenever he thought of the latter&#8217;s deception
about his name. And the probabilities were that
a letter from him, Ross, would not move the father
to clemency.</p>

<p>In this undecided state of mind, Ross strolled
into the lobby the following morning, considering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
how he could best kill time until the stage started
for Meeteetse that evening. As he was standing
in front of a window, his hands deep in his pockets,
the sheriff and Sandy rode past, followed by
Waymart. Neither the sheriff nor Waymart
looked his way. But Sandy did, and, grinning,
raised his hand in a graceful salute. Ross, nodding,
felt his anger at Sandy dying. Distrust him
as he must, Ross could not dislike him. In this
strange state of mind, however, the boy was by no
means alone throughout the length and breadth
of Big Horn County.</p>

<p>"They&#8217;re going now after the right chap,"
thought Ross, and a wave of sympathy for Leslie
began to wash away his resentment.</p>

<p>In the end, he spent the greater part of the day
composing a letter to old man Quinn, wherein he
set forth Leslie&#8217;s position, prospects and altered
feelings in bald statements containing but few
adjectives. In explaining who the writer was he
gave a brief account of his connection with the
sheriff. Between the acts of composing, tearing
up, and rewriting the composition, he searched
Cody for Lon Weston, but could not find him.</p>

<p>When, that evening, he climbed into the stage
behind Andy, he had sent the letter to Leslie&#8217;s
father and had not caught a glimpse of Weston.</p>

<p>At the stage camp he was the butt of much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
congratulation and derision from the hilarious Hank.
"Say, you made the sheriff mad as a hornet, but
he had t&#8217; own up ye cheated &#8217;im out of a year&#8217;s
growth. Sandy set the hull thing out in good
shape. But why didn&#8217;t ye stick t&#8217; yer job instid
of layin&#8217; down &#8217;n&#8217; kickin&#8217; up yer heels before the
time?"</p>

<p>"Because I&#8217;m no good, Hank, this side of the
Mississippi River," returned Ross in humility of
spirit. "Don&#8217;t knock me&#8211;you can&#8217;t get ahead of
me in that respect! I&#8217;ve kicked myself all over
Cody to-day."</p>

<p>The following morning, at Meeteetse, he joined
Bill Travers and the Miners&#8217; Camp stage and
started on the all day&#8217;s journey into the mountains.
At noon, he began looking for the sheriff
and Leslie. He had calculated that they would
meet the stage at the half-way ranch and there he
would tell Leslie what he had written his father.
But no Leslie appeared. All the afternoon during
the stage&#8217;s progress into the mountains, Ross
looked for the sheriff and his prisoner, but he
looked in vain.</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock, Bill Travers dropped his one
passenger in front of Steele&#8217;s shack, and Ross,
climbing Gale&#8217;s Ridge, opened the door on the
superintendent in the act of sitting down to
supper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>"Hello, there!" cried Steele grasping the boy&#8217;s
chilled hand. "Here&#8217;s the best elk steak you ever
planted your teeth in. Draw up and tell me what
you&#8217;ve been up to, skylarking off to Cody with the
sheriff."</p>

<p>Ross followed directions, and soon was giving
Steele the entire story of his capture and failure.</p>

<p>Steele, forgetting to eat, alternated between
amusement and amazement. "By George, I don&#8217;t
wonder that sheriff was mad! You see, Doc, he&#8217;s
new to the business of being sheriff. You were
his first arrest."</p>

<p>"Probably if he were not so new he wouldn&#8217;t
have been so easily fooled."</p>

<p>"I can&#8217;t say," retorted Steele, "that he was
easily fooled. Strikes me you were about as slow
with him as greased lightning."</p>

<p>Ross flushed at the praise. It was balm to his
wounds in his self-esteem.</p>

<p>Early the following morning, he started for
Meadow Creek, and at the upper camp learned
something for which he was unprepared and which
was a source of temporary satisfaction to him.</p>

<p>Leslie had disappeared.</p>

<p>Until noon Ross lingered in camp watching the
sheriff and Sandy pass and repass in their search
for the runaway. Finally, just before noon, he
saw them on snow-shoes striking out up Wood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
River cañon into the uninhabited wilderness
beyond. Then he slowly mounted the dizzy trail
leading to Weimer&#8217;s shack and the interrupted
work.</p>

<p>"It must have been my note that warned him,"
Ross thought as he watched the figures toiling up
Wood River cañon. "I hope they have the chase
of their lives," he said aloud, "and then I can
patronize Sandy and stroke him down as he did
me at &#8217;The Irma&#8217;&#8211;provided I dare!"</p>

<p>He found Weimer sitting beside the fire smoking
and growling over the absence of both his assistants.</p>

<p>"Dot poy," he explained, "read dot paper you
wrote and den vat does he do, hein? He says
notings, aber he takes some tings and out he
goes und leaves me mit der vork und mit mine
eyes, und dey so pad!"</p>

<p>This was the extent of the information he was
able to give Ross concerning Leslie. Many grievances
he had against the sheriff and "dem McKenzies"
that had ransacked the premises and
had ridden to and fro, over to Wilson&#8217;s and round
the mountains searching for traces of Leslie.</p>

<p>As it turned out, they might have found a trace
of him had they searched more thoroughly, for
the following day, Ross, diving into the pocket of
his slicker for some nails that he carried there,
came on a folded note pinned in the bottom of the
pocket.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i5'></a><img src='images/i-202.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
BESIDE THE DYNAMITE BOX
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>"All I understand from your letter," ran the
note, "is that it has given me a chance to make
my getaway. It was a mighty white thing of
you to do, and I appreciate it, though I know I
haven&#8217;t acted that way. You&#8217;ve probably found
out what my name is by this time. I didn&#8217;t tell
you, because I was so dead ashamed about the
whole matter that I hated to face myself and disgrace
the name. But I never thought father
would do such a thing as he has, and so I shall
clear out and stay cleared until he has stopped
hunting. I know where I&#8217;m going, and you&#8217;ll see
me in Meadow Creek after father goes back and
has given me up.&#8211;<span class='sc'>Leslie Jones Quinn</span>."</p>

<p>Ross, standing on the dump beside the dynamite
box, a hammer in one hand, read the letter. At
once all his remaining resentment against Leslie
disappeared. "I guess I would have done the
same about the name in his place," he concluded.</p>

<p>Pinning the note in his pocket again for safe
keeping he repaired the dynamite box. Then he
entered the tunnel, where Weimer was once more
at work drilling for a blast.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jake," he asked, "when did Leslie
leave, what time in the day?"</p>

<p>"It vas not day, it vas night," growled Weimer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
wrestling with the drill. "He vent avay mit
darkness."</p>

<p>"That accounts," said Ross, "for his not having
been seen in camp."</p>

<p>He felt certain that Leslie would take refuge in
the shack up Wood River cañon where Wilson
had stored some of the supplies in preparation for
the winter&#8217;s work on the coal claims. In this
case he would be discovered, for it was in that
direction that the sheriff and Sandy had gone as
Ross was climbing the Crosby trail. Therefore,
it was with anxiety that the boy looked for the
return of the McKenzies.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen when he left the tunnel
that night, and as he emerged from the trees that
clustered about the dump, he saw a light in the
McKenzie cabin. Without waiting for his supper,
he crossed the little valley and rapped on the
door.</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc," came Sandy&#8217;s voice from within.
"Haul up the latch-string and show yerself.
Comin&#8217; to crow over us, ain&#8217;t ye?" he continued
as Ross entered. "Well, that ye can, fer we can&#8217;t
find hide ner hair of Leslie, and the sheriff has hit
the trail to Basin about as mad as they make &#8217;em
over the whole thing!"</p>

<p>Here Sandy threw his head back and laughed
as amusedly as though the entire affair were a joke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
of his own manufacture. He did not seem to
harbor the least resentment against Ross for having
blocked the wheels of his game. Rather, he applauded
the blocking frankly, while Waymart
smoked stolidly beside the table and said nothing.</p>

<p>"That little note that you left for Less is what
done the business," Sandy went on cheerfully reviewing
the situation. "The sheriff had forgot
that note &#8217;til we got up here and the bird wa&#8217;n&#8217;t t&#8217;
be found in the hand ner the bush neither. That
was a neat little trick, Doc, almost as neat as the
way ye come it over the sheriff on the trail to
Cody. Guess he&#8217;ll not fergit ye fer a spell! Mart,
don&#8217;t be s&#8217; stingy with that weed. Hand over
some. My pipe is about as empty as the sheriff&#8217;s
head."</p>

<p>"Why did you do it, Sandy?" Ross burst out.
"What made you send word to Leslie&#8217;s father that
he was here?"</p>

<p>Sandy composedly filled his pipe and lighted it.
"It was cruelty t&#8217; little children not t&#8217;, Doc. The
very idee of Leslie Jones leavin&#8217; his pa and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"His name isn&#8217;t Jones, and you know it, and I
know it!" interrupted Ross. He could not keep
the ring of triumph from his tone. "He is Leslie
Quinn."</p>

<p>Sandy&#8217;s hand traveled slowly to his pipe. "Is
he? How&#8217;d you find out?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>"Easily enough," said Ross carelessly, "when
you know how."</p>

<p>Both Waymart and Sandy regarded the boy intently.
"Been back here then, has he?" they
asked in one breath.</p>

<p>Ross arose. "&#8217;It would be cruelty to little children&#8217;
to tell you!" he quoted boldly and opened
the door.</p>

<p>Waymart gave an exclamation and sprang to his
feet. His hands were clenched. But Sandy, kicking
him under the table, guffawed.</p>

<p>"Give and take, Mart," he exclaimed. "I&#8217;m
willin&#8217; t&#8217; chew my own words, and if I am willin&#8217;
there ain&#8217;t no kick comin&#8217; from you!"</p>

<p>The following day Ross wrote another letter to
Leslie&#8217;s father and enclosed the note he had found
pinned in his pocket. This letter he entrusted to
Wilson to mail in Cody, for Wilson was going to
Butte for a few weeks before beginning his winter&#8217;s
work on his coal claims. He stopped at noon to
bid Weimer and Ross good-bye.</p>

<p>"Nothin&#8217; would hire me t&#8217; stay over here all
winter," were his last words to Ross.</p>

<p>Although the latter had seen but little of the
prospector, his departure made the valley seem
lonelier than ever, and caused Ross to cling desperately
to the idea of the McKenzies remaining.
As the days passed, and more snow fell, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
brothers began to get decidedly uneasy. They accounted
for their uneasiness to Ross by telling him
they were in need of supplies and saw no way of
getting any over from Miners&#8217; Camp. Sandy was
the informant, as usual, while Waymart&#8217;s eyebrows
were lifted in momentary surprise. By that
time every horse in Miners&#8217; Camp had been sent
"below." There was but little grass on the mountains
during the brief summer; and through the
winter, which occupied nine months of the year,
every ounce of fodder must be packed over the
difficult road from the ranches.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t see," quoth Sandy unconvincingly,
"but what we&#8217;ll have to strike the trail. Hain&#8217;t
no way, as I can see, to pack grub over except on
our backs, and that&#8217;s too slow."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in Weimer&#8217;s
cabin. The wind moaned and wailed among the
hemlocks, and whistled savagely past the cabin.
In his bunk Weimer snored. Above them came
the cry of the coyotes, like a child&#8217;s long-drawn
scream of pain and fear. The terror of loneliness
among those overhanging mountains gripped at the
boy&#8217;s throat. For a moment he could not speak.</p>

<p>Then, "If you could get provisions over easily,
would you stay longer?"</p>

<p>Sandy crossed his legs restfully. "Sure," he answered
readily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>That week, therefore, Ross used his spare time&#8211;and
some time which he ought not to have spared&#8211;in
making a sled. It was, when finished, a
crude but efficient affair, the runners being surmounted
by a double-decked box. This vehicle
he exhibited one day to the McKenzies as the
prospective conveyor of their supplies over the
mountains.</p>

<p>Sandy stood in front of the shack, his hands in
his pockets, his cap pushed well back on his head
and the front lock of hair falling over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Doc, you&#8217;re the stuff!" he cried warmly.
"There&#8217;s an idee or two floatin&#8217; around in yer tenderfoot
brain, ain&#8217;t there?"</p>

<p>Tied to both front and rear of the sled were
ropes, two in front, one behind. Those in front
differed in length.</p>

<p>"See?" explained Ross. "Two can&#8217;t walk
abreast on the trail, but still it&#8217;s easier for each one
to pull on his own rope. That&#8217;s the reason I made
&#8217;em of different lengths. Then one of us behind
can hold the sled from slipping off the trail with
the rear rope. In this way we can bring up a big
load of supplies."</p>

<p>Sandy removed his cap, and pushed back his
hair.</p>

<p>"Doc, where was you raised? Guess I&#8217;ll go back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
t&#8217; the same place, and be raised over agin. It
might pay." His tone expressed an admiration
that was almost genuine.</p>

<p>Waymart said nothing. He scarcely glanced at
the sled, but turned away scowling up toward the
tunnel where, as he had informed himself, Ross
and Weimer were doing an amazingly good piece
of work.</p>

<p>As they started back toward their own shack,
Ross heard Waymart say angrily to Sandy, "Are
you goin&#8217; to take the use of that sled?"</p>

<p>And Sandy&#8217;s answer, "For sure, now! What&#8217;s
eatin&#8217; you, Mart? Doc&#8217;s got a good head on &#8217;im."</p>

<p>"Entirely too good fer us, mebby!" growled
Waymart; and Ross smiled in satisfaction, thinking
they referred to his work in the tunnel.</p>

<p>Just before supper, the door of Weimer&#8217;s shack
unceremoniously opened, and Waymart&#8217;s arm was
thrust in. "Here," his voice said roughly, "take
this here elk steak."</p>

<p>Ross relieved the arm of its burden, and the door
closed sharply. It was a sirloin steak, the juiciest
and most tender in the animal which the brothers
had brought into the valley the day before. Sandy
had often brought them venison before, but never
Waymart; and Ross was pleased.</p>

<p>"While Sandy is entertaining," Ross had told
Steele, "and Waymart seldom says two sentences at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
one sitting, and next to never meets my eye, yet, if
it came right down to a choice, I believe I&#8217;d rather
travel along with Waymart than with Sandy."</p>

<p>"Your choice is all right," Steele had replied.
"If Waymart would cut loose from Sandy, he&#8217;d
earn an honest living. It&#8217;s Sandy that&#8217;s the head,
though. It&#8217;s Sandy that plans; Waymart furnishes
the feet and arms. Sandy&#8217;s good company, but I
wouldn&#8217;t trust him with my pocketbook around
the corner. Not," Steele added, "that he&#8217;d steal it
in such a way that the law could touch him. No,
he&#8217;d have the pocketbook, but it &#8217;ud leave him
free to look any jury in the eye and to shake hands
with me afterward."</p>

<p>The new sled made its first journey down into
Miners&#8217; Camp one Sunday in December two weeks
after Ross had ridden down with the sheriff.
Waymart went ahead with one of the leading-ropes
over his shoulder, and Sandy behind, steadying the
empty vehicle around the shoulder of Crosby.
Waymart led because he was the heaviest, and
there was a deep fall of snow to contend against
except around the shoulder, where, fortunately, the
wind had swept the mountain clean.</p>

<p>As the trail broadened beyond, Waymart paused
to survey the low-hanging clouds. Ross, in the
rear, stopped and studied the mountains which
Nature had in ages past taken in her gigantic hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
and flung into the cañon between Dundee and
Crosby, compelling Wood River to crawl and worm
and wind and cut its way deep and narrow down
into Miners&#8217; Camp.</p>

<p>"I wonder," exclaimed Ross suddenly to Sandy,
"what is beyond that conglomeration of peaks."</p>

<p>"Wood River cañon still, clean over on top of
the Divide, and you can follow it on horseback
right through. Part of the time up there," waving
his hand toward the jumble of mountains
which seemingly ended the cañon, "it&#8217;s pretty
rocky trailin&#8217;, especially in winter, but it can be
done."</p>

<p>Sandy rested one foot on the edge of the sled.
Waymart glued his eyes on the Camp far below.
From various projecting stovepipes volumes of
smoke were curling straight up in the windless air.
From the tunnel of the Mountain Company almost
opposite them came a succession of blasts which
stirred the echoes between Dundee and Crosby.
The Mountain Company were no respecters of Sunday.
They were also working day and night in
view of the near shut-down of the works.</p>

<p>But Ross&#8217;s gaze was seeking to penetrate further
toward the source of Wood River. "Any one living
beyond there?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sandy grinned. "Elk, mountain-sheep, coyotes,
bears, and timber wolves."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>"But no people?"</p>

<p>"Nope. There ain&#8217;t a man livin&#8217; &#8217;twixt here
and the Yellowstone Park&#8211;now. Last summer a
few prospectors sort of strolled up Wood River a
few dozen miles, but they hiked it out, I tell ye,
when snow come."</p>

<p>"I wish," Ross said impulsively, "that I could
go over there exploring."</p>

<p>Waymart lifted his eyes the fraction of a moment,
and encountered Sandy&#8217;s. A peculiar expression
passed between them. Then Waymart&#8217;s
gaze fell again on the Camp, and Sandy replied
carelessly to Ross:</p>

<p>"After you git the work done in your tunnel
better strike some of these trails, but not in winter.
They ain&#8217;t safe, especially for a tenderfoot."</p>

<p>"But in the summer," returned Ross absently,
"I don&#8217;t expect to be here."</p>

<p>"Oh&#8211;that so?" and Sandy gave the sled a
careless push.</p>

<p>Waymart drew the rope over his shoulder, and
once more the trio descended the trail.</p>

<p>At the upper camp Ross left the brothers to
purchase their supplies while he visited the post-office
and Steele. At the former place he found
a note to himself from Leslie&#8217;s father and a bulkier
letter addressed to Leslie in his care. Mr. Quinn
had received both of Ross&#8217;s letters, he wrote, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
last with the enclosure from Leslie. He had taken
the steps necessary to recall the warrant, which, he
explained, had seemed to him the "surest and
quickest way of fetching the boy home," and
would allow Leslie to return to Ross as his note
indicated that he desired. On his return Ross
was to give up the letter put in his care. Mr.
Quinn closed his communication with thanks to
Ross for the trouble he had been to, also, for his
assurance that Leslie was boning down to work!</p>

<p>Two weeks had elapsed since Leslie disappeared.
Nothing had been seen of him nor heard of him
in either the upper or lower camps, and Ross returned
to Meadow Creek troubled in spirit.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;m afraid," he told himself as he helped the
McKenzies haul their supplies up the trail, "that
I&#8217;ve made even a bigger mess of it all the way
around than I thought at first."</p>

<p>Steele, from his doorway, watched Ross out of
sight that afternoon, with a pleased smile on his
bearded lips. He was a tanned and freckled Ross
now. Sun and wind and work in the open for
two months had left their marks on the boy. He
stood straighter, walked more firmly, and had laid
on pounds of muscle.</p>

<p>"He&#8217;s put himself through good and plenty,
as well as holding Uncle Jake&#8217;s nose to the grindstone,"
concluded Steele, turning back into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
cabin. On the making of the sled he had commented
but briefly to Ross, realizing how much
the presence of the McKenzies meant to the boy.
To himself he thought, however:</p>

<p>"That Sandy McKenzie! How he does manage
to make other folks do his work!"</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>During the week which followed, a stranger
passed through Miners&#8217; Camp. He was seen by
only one man, "Society Bill," who belonged to
the Gale&#8217;s Ridge outfit.</p>

<p>"He asked the way to the Meader Creek trail,"
Society Bill told Steele. "Now, I wonder if he&#8217;s
a new one of them McKenzies. I never set my
two eyes on &#8217;im before."</p>

<p>"Horseback?" asked Steele.</p>

<p>"Yep. Decent sort of bronc he rode. Told me
to tell Bill Travers to drive it down below to-morrow
if it got down this far."</p>

<p>"That looks as if he knew what he was about,
and intended to stay," mused Steele.</p>

<p>Early the following morning the "decent sort
of broncho," with its bridle reins tied to the
pommel of the saddle, was discovered in front
of Steele&#8217;s shack, pawing the snow in an ineffectual
attempt to get a breakfast. Bill Travers,
returning with the stage, according to request,
drove the beast ahead of him down to the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
ranch, and, taking off saddle and bridle, turned
it into a large corral with dozens of other horses
to winter. In the spring one by one the owners
would straggle along, identify their horses and
saddles, pay their bills, and depart for the mountains.</p>

<p>The owner of the ranch pitched the saddle
under a shed, and thought no more about the
transaction. Bill Travers, whirling his whip over
the backs of his four stage horses, gave the stranger
and his horse no more thought. Society Bill,
having disseminated his news among the other
miners, presently forgot it. But Amos Steele
neither forgot nor ceased to speculate.</p>

<p>"Who is he, and what is he doing on the
Creek?" Steele asked himself.</p>

<p>The first part of the question Ross answered the
following Sunday. He could scarcely wait to open
the door before announcing:</p>

<p>"Lon Weston is over on the Creek. He is
cousin to the McKenzies!"</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>MEADOW CREEK VALLEY MISSES LESLIE</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span> could scarcely believe the evidence of his
own senses when he saw Lon Weston riding along
the trail below the dump. The boy had pushed
the car with its load of ore out to the bumper and
dumped it before he saw the horseman in the
sheepskin coat, the hairy chaps, and a fur cap
drawn over forehead and ears. The horse shied
at the chunks of ore rolling almost to its feet, and
Weston looked up.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" shouted Ross. "What on earth
are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Weston drew in his horse. "Hello, Doc!" he
returned with gruff pleasantness without answering
the question.</p>

<p>"Doc" slipped and slid down the snowy path
to the trail, and held out a cordial hand.</p>

<p>"How&#8217;s your leg?"</p>

<p>"All right." Weston gripped the extended hand
heartily. "Almost as good &#8217;s new."</p>

<p>His brown eyes above his heavy stubby beard
held a pleasanter expression than Ross had seen
in them while nursing their owner. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
deep eyes, capable of mirroring accurately the
varied moods of the man looking out of them.</p>

<p>"I didn&#8217;t recognize you in Cody three weeks
ago," Ross was beginning when Weston interrupted
him.</p>

<p>Leaning down from his saddle he met the boy&#8217;s
eyes steadily. "Remember," he said slowly and
meaningly, "that you didn&#8217;t see me&#8211;nor hear
from me&#8211;in Cody."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Ross, embarrassed by the
fixity of the other&#8217;s stare. "I&#8217;ll forget it hereafter,
but I want to thank<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Cut it out," commanded Weston briefly,
straightening again in the saddle.</p>

<p>"At least," invited Ross, "you&#8217;ll come to dinner
with me. Uncle Jake is frying ham and onions.
Smell &#8217;em? I got some onions and half a dozen
apples over at Camp Sunday." His voice could
not have been more eager had he been relating the
finding of free gold. "Come on in, and have
some."</p>

<p>Weston&#8217;s eyes slipped away from Ross&#8217;s in a way
which reminded the latter of Waymart&#8217;s, and
rested on the smoke from the cabin a quarter of a
mile away.</p>

<p>"Guess not, to-day. Thank you just the same.
The boys are probably rustlin&#8217; grub this minute
and they&#8217;ll be expectin&#8217; me. See you again."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>Ross stood motionless, looking after him.
Weston rode sitting straight, unlike the usual
careless forward droop of the cow puncher. He
was a well-built man, although his shoulders were
rather narrow. But the only characteristic that
Ross noticed was the grip of the left knee against
the horse. For the strength of that grip he was
responsible, but it was a responsibility which Lon
did not seem to recognize.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy realized the newcomer&#8217;s
words. So Sandy and Waymart were expecting
him, but had said nothing about it to Ross. And
when Ross had told them about Lon Weston at the
stage camp they had made no sign that they knew
him. That was strange.</p>

<p>He turned slowly toward the cabin, where
Weimer was frying ham and onions and boiling
coffee. Opening the cabin door he was met by a
white gust of steam mingled with savory smoke.
He propped the door open, and brought in an
armful of wood.</p>

<p>Weimer, in his shirt-sleeves, was bending his
head over a little stove, which offered barely room
for a small kettle and a skillet with a coffee-pot
sandwiched in between. A sheet-iron oven stood
on the floor, the top answering for a sideboard.
When Weimer made biscuits and sour dough
bread, the oven was placed on top of the stove.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>Ross threw his wood down on the hard dirt
floor, and put a stick into the stove by way of the
wide front door. The pine instantly blazed up,
showing a wide crack which zigzagged across the
side of the old stove.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jake,"&#8211;Ross sat back on one heel, and
looked up at his partner whose blinking eyes were
in the gloom of the cabin unprotected now by
goggles,&#8211;"Uncle Jake, a stranger has just come
into Meadow Creek City on the Limited."</p>

<p>Weimer chuckled. Before the advent of his
youthful "pard" the old man&#8211;Ross always
thought of him as old despite his black hair and
great strength&#8211;had not laughed in months.</p>

<p>"He stopped at the second station," pursued
Ross.</p>

<p>Weimer&#8217;s face instantly darkened. "At the
McKenzies&#8217;? One of dem consarned gang, he
ist?"</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s what I want to know. It&#8217;s Lon Weston,
the fellow I told you I took care of at the stage
camp."</p>

<p>Weimer dumped ham and onions into an agateware
basin, and set it on the table. "I don&#8217;t
know him, I don&#8217;t. But he comes to der McKenzies,
hein? Und after all dose days you spen&#8217;
mit him!" Uncle Jack frowned heavily, and,
sitting down, helped himself to boiled "spuds."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>"I tink I knew all dem consarned gang, but dere
ist no Veston mit &#8217;em."</p>

<p>Ross dragged to the little bare board table a box
marked in big letters, "Ruford&#8217;s Canned Tomatoes,
The Yellow Brand," and, turning the box
on end, straddled it opposite Weimer.</p>

<p>Weimer, eating and drinking noisily, found
time to ask vindictively, "Ist he for more medicine
come mit you?"</p>

<p>Ross shook his head, and bent over his plate.</p>

<p>The plate was tin. The cup out of which he
drank his coffee was also tin. His knife and fork
were steel, and his spoon was pewter. The place
of the lacking milk pitcher was usurped by a tin
can of condensed milk with the top bent back and
the milk dried all over the sides. But Ross ate&#8211;how
he ate! Potatoes followed ham, and coffee
followed potatoes, and onions followed both, and
then he began all over again. Never had eating
been such serious work with him. But never,
also, had his muscles been so firm and hard. As
for a pickaxe, it was coming to feel no heavier than
the baseball bat which he had always rather
scorned.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he began after a pause, "what
Lon&#8217;s up to here, anyway."</p>

<p>The question started Weimer on his favorite
topic, the claim jumpers and the injustice of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
mining laws. He could not talk fast enough in
English, and so dropped into his native German.</p>

<p>Ross, accustomed to his tirades, cleared away
the dishes, pushed the table back against the dirt
chinked logs, and lay down on the blankets of his
bunk for a few moments, his eyes glued on the
little nickel clock.</p>

<p>He broke into the other&#8217;s scolding monologue.
"In ten minutes we must go back to work."</p>

<p>Weimer scowled darkly. His lids, red and
swollen, almost obscured his pale-blue eyes.
"Mine eyes ist too pad to-day," he declared. "I
vill not to go out in de sun again."</p>

<p>A few weeks before, this oft-repeated declaration
had alarmed Ross. Now he made no reply. But,
when the hands of the nickel clock indicated one,
he arose and put on his oiled jumper and oilskin
cap.</p>

<p>"Come, Uncle Jake," he said in a strong, decided
tone. "Here are your goggles. Get busy, or the
McKenzie outfit will have our claims in spite of
us. Now, when there are three to watch instead
of two, we must show the mettle we&#8217;re made of."</p>

<p>Moved by the magic statement, ever new and
ever powerful, that the claims might be jumped,
Uncle Jake, forgetting that in substance he had
made the same objection to work twice a day for
weeks and that Ross had overcome his objections
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
in substantially the same way, "got busy." And
presently Ross led him out, his eyes not only
securely goggled, but covered as well with a black
cloth which he pressed fearfully against the goggles.</p>

<p>The snow was Weimer&#8217;s evil genius. He lived
in dread of the sight of it. Without assistance he
would not move a dozen paces away from the
cabin after the sun had risen on Meadow Creek
Valley. But the fear of the light had made as great
an impression on his mind as the light itself had
made on his eyes, and he had fallen into the habit,
before Ross came, of staying in his cabin during
cloudy days, lest, if he ventured out, the sun
might break through the clouds.</p>

<p>The old partner and the young went up the
steep trail to the tunnel, Ross leading Weimer up
over the side of the dump and into the mouth of
the tunnel. In the shelter of its gloom the latter
removed his goggles; and, stumbling along over
the chunks of ore lying beside the narrow track,
he reached the end of the short tunnel which had
been blasted from the solid rock. Lighting a fresh
candle, he set it in its socket at the end of a sharply
pointed iron, a miner&#8217;s candlestick, and, jabbing
the point into a crevice, leisurely surveyed the
wall before him. Behind him the little empty car
filled the tunnel with sound as Ross pushed it
rattling and jolting over the rusty rails.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>"Ready to drill for another shot, ain&#8217;t we?"
Ross asked. He pushed the car back out of the
way. "Got to hustle to get it done this afternoon,
too."</p>

<p>Under the stimulus of Ross&#8217;s presence and hustle
the older man fell to work valiantly, but it was
slow work. Down in Miners&#8217; Camp machinery
performed the task which Weimer was doing laboriously
with the aid of a hand drill. Before him,
at the end of the tunnel, was a seamed and uneven
wall of rock a little higher than his head and a
little broader than his reach had he extended his
arms on either side. In this wall he patiently
drilled three sets of holes, into which the "sticks"
were placed for the next "shot," as the explosion
of dynamite was called. In mining terms the old
man was "putting a shot." Near the top of the
wall he made three holes. Half-way down were
two more, long and inclined toward each other at
the top. These were the "cut-in holes." Lastly,
at the foot of the wall were three large holes called
"lifters." The contents of the top holes and the
cut-ins were set off first, splintering and cracking
the rock. Then the lifters were exploded, actually
lifting the loosened mass above it and hurling it
into the tunnel.</p>

<p>When quiet reigned again, and Ross had loaded
his hand car with the débris, he pushed it out on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
the dump again through the moist, freezing atmosphere
of the tunnel. There was water everywhere.
Near the mouth of the tunnel it was frozen on the
sides and the top, and carpeted the floor with slush.
Further in it was unfrozen, oozing out of the sides,
dripping from the roof, running along the track.
It covered the oiled garments of the men at work.
It put out their candles. It made muck of the
quartz dust on the floor. It often destroyed the
lighted fuses.</p>

<p>There was something maddening to Ross in its
incessant drip and drizzle, and he always emerged
on the dump with a feeling of relief, especially
when the sun shone as it did that day in dazzling
brightness.</p>

<p>He dumped the car, and was about to push it
back when his eyes fell on Weston&#8217;s horse journeying
on the back trail riderless.</p>

<p>"That means," thought Ross, "that he&#8217;s going
to stay. Why?"</p>

<p>A feeling of relief was mixed with uneasiness.
The relief was caused by this further link in the
chain of evidence that when the trail to Miners&#8217;
Camp was closed it would not close on Weimer
and him alone. The uneasiness had to do with
the mission of the McKenzie outfit in Meadow
Creek Valley. Why were they reinforced by
Weston?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>"Oh!" exclaimed Ross aloud in sudden disgust
with himself. "He&#8217;s come to hunt, of course!
His gun was strapped on behind. I never thought
of that. If he belongs to the McKenzie outfit,
he&#8217;d rather hunt than eat."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the "outfit" bore him
not the slightest grudge or ill will. Sandy, indeed,
seemed openly to like him, Waymart tolerated
him with a surly good humor, while Weston&#8211;here
Ross knit his brow&#8211;Weston baffled him completely;
still, considering the incident of the note
in Cody, the boy looked on him as a friend albeit
one who evidently did not care to pose in that capacity
before the McKenzies.</p>

<p>From his position Ross could look down and
across on the claims of the McKenzies and almost
into the "discovery hole" in which they were
supposed to be working. Waymart was leisurely
drilling a hole in the rock to receive a stick of
dynamite when Sandy came out of the cabin and
walked rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>The two talked together a moment, and then
Weston joined them. In a moment the three fell
apart, and appeared to be talking excitedly. Presently
Waymart dropped the discussion, and turning
his back walked away a few steps with his
hands in his pockets and stood in a listening attitude.
Ross watched with absorbing interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
Even at that distance he could see that the discussion
between the other two was not amiable. The
scene lasted but a few moments, and then all three
descended to the cabin together.</p>

<p>That evening after supper, Ross washed the
day&#8217;s dishes, brought in wood, and put the room
to rights, while Weimer alternately smoked and
snored in his bunk. The room was dimly lighted
by candles in candlesticks thrust into logs. Ross,
so tired and sleepy he could scarcely keep his eyes
open, hung up the dish-pan on its nail beside the
stove, and looked longingly toward the emergency
chest pushed beneath his bunk. Not one word
had he mastered of the contents of the books he
had stowed away there with such high hopes.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t believe the McKenzies are coming
over," he told Weimer, as he filled the stove and
wound up the clock. "It&#8217;s too late for them."</p>

<p>Weimer made no reply. His pipe had fallen on
his chest, and his hair-encircled mouth was wide
open in a vacuous sleep. At that moment the rising
wind beat the snow against the window, and
Ross uttered an exclamation. He had forgotten to
shut the tool-house door, and, fearing that with
the wind in the south the little log house would be
filled with snow before morning, he went back up
the trail to the tunnel. Climbing noiselessly over
the soft snow, he arrived at the ore dump, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
making for the tool house across the mouth of the
tunnel when a light flickered in his path.</p>

<p>Startled, he looked into the tunnel, and saw
three figures at the end silhouetted against the dim
candle-light.</p>

<p>"Lon, Sandy and Waymart," he muttered.</p>

<p>There was no danger of his being discovered, so
dark was the night. Therefore, he sat down on his
heels beside the tool house, and watched, puzzled
at first to understand the movements of the men.</p>

<p>"Oh," he muttered suddenly, "they&#8217;re measuring
to see how fast the work is going."</p>

<p>With a tape line the men were estimating the
cubic feet of rock excavated by Ross and Weimer.</p>

<p>Ross hugged his knees, and exulted. His
"friends the enemy" might measure all they
chose, he thought; and every length of the tape
line would reveal to them the futility of waiting
to jump the Weimer-Grant claims.</p>

<p>Presently the three started out of the tunnel.
Ross, seeking a hiding-place, found it behind a
clump of low spruce trees at the right of the
tunnel&#8217;s mouth. The intruders blew out their
candles as they came out on the dump.</p>

<p>"At this rate," Ross heard Waymart say,
"they&#8217;re solid on these here claims."</p>

<p>But, although he strained his ears, he could
hear nothing more. After a brief wait the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
sound of twigs breaking under their shoes died
away; and Ross, leaving his hiding-place, shut
the tool-house door and went back to the cabin.</p>

<p>He found Weimer awake and whistling in his
bunk. Ross paused at the door, regarding him
curiously. It was the first time he had ever heard
the old man make this cheerful sound, although
Steele had said he used to be called Whistling
Weimer as well as Dutch Weimer.</p>

<p>"Hello, Uncle Jake!" cried Ross. "Feeling
pretty gay, aren&#8217;t you?"</p>

<p>Weimer stopped in the middle of his tune, and
blinked at Ross. "Nein," he denied, "I ain&#8217;t
feelin&#8217; gay. If your eyes vas<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross interrupted. "Now, see here, Uncle Jake;
you know your eyes are better since I&#8217;ve taken to
doctoring them."</p>

<p>The last few weeks had certainly improved the
old man. His eyes were better, owing to a cooling
lotion which Ross had dropped under the lids
twice a day. Weimer&#8217;s mind was clearer because
his growing confidence in his young partner had
quieted his fears. Ross&#8217;s cheerfulness was also
contagious. Nor did the cleanliness on which the
boy insisted lower Weimer&#8217;s vitality. Soap became
a known quantity to him.</p>

<p>All these favorable circumstances reacted on
Weimer&#8217;s work. He was becoming more and more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
efficient, and Ross&#8217;s spirits had risen as the days
passed; and he saw the growing intelligence
manifested by the other in regard to operations
in the tunnel. This change for the better in
Uncle Jake had not passed unnoticed by the
McKenzies.</p>

<p>Ross said nothing to the old man about the
scene he had just witnessed in the tunnel. It
would do no good, and would only inflame the
other&#8217;s wrath. Therefore, he snuffed the candles,
repeating mechanically:</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t believe the McKenzies are coming over
to-night."</p>

<p>But at that moment footsteps sounded outside
the door. The snow creaked under the pressure
of shoes, and Sandy and Waymart entered.</p>

<p>Sandy was as gay and talkative as ever, but not
Waymart. He sat down on a box, leaned back
against the logs, turned up his coat collar to protect
himself from the icy wind, which sought out
the dirt-chinked crevices, and, pulling a mouth-organ
from his pocket, began to play. Nor did
he stop until Sandy rose to go. A sombre figure
he made back among the shadows, his eyes resting
vacantly on the floor at his feet. One leg was
crossed over the other, the toe moving in time to
the discordant music. Waymart&#8217;s thoughts did
not seem to be cheerful companions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>But Sandy had drawn a box close up beside the
roaring fire, and sat with his elbows on his knees
and a pipe in his mouth. He paid no attention
to Weimer nor to his musical brother, but told
Ross yarns of the gold-fields of Montana and
Nevada, tales concerning other men, Ross noticed;
Sandy never talked about himself.</p>

<p>The evening passed and the men rose to depart
without having mentioned the newcomer; and
Ross, with the thought of their previous reticence
concerning him in mind, waited for them
to speak first.</p>

<p>It was Sandy who spoke, but not until his hand
was on the door and Waymart stood outside the
cabin. Then he said carelessly, as though Ross
had never seen Weston before, and as though the
coming of a relative was an every-day event in
Meadow Creek Valley:</p>

<p>"Cousin hiked it over the mountain to-day.
We&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; strike th&#8217; trail over t&#8217; the Divide
to-morrow, huntin&#8217;. He&#8217;s great on game."</p>

<p>"So," thought Ross, "I&#8217;m right. It&#8217;s hunting
that has brought him here."</p>

<p>The next morning at daylight, Ross, eating
breakfast, chanced to glance out of the dirty
west window. Up near the summit of Soapweed
Ledge, which met Crosby at right angles,
he saw three figures advancing single file. Each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
carried a gun, and had a small pack and snow-shoes
strapped on his back.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jake," asked Ross suddenly, "have you
ever been over to the Divide?"</p>

<p>Weimer shook his head. "No, I stay home and
attend to pizness."</p>

<p>"Haven&#8217;t you ever crossed that mountain?"
Ross indicated Soapweed Ledge.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What&#8217;s beyond?"</p>

<p>"More mountains," answered Weimer vaguely,
"und peyond dem more und more."</p>

<p>It was a week before the hunters returned, a
long lonely week for Ross. Each morning he
told himself hopefully that before night Leslie
might return, but, to his increasing dismay, no
Leslie came.</p>

<p>"Can it be that an accident has happened to
him, somewhere, alone, or has he changed his
mind about coming and gone back home?"</p>

<p>Ross asked himself this question as he stood at
the mouth of the tunnel one morning staring in
the direction of Soapweed Ledge. A heavy snowstorm
had set in that morning, and in the afternoon
the falling snow shrouded the Ledge in a
white veil out of which the three men now
emerged, moving slowly across the little valley.
Their snow-shoes were on their feet, and in place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
of the light packs with which they had started
their shoulders were bent under loads of venison.</p>

<p>The McKenzies had returned.</p>

<p>That evening Waymart appeared at Weimer&#8217;s
door with a goodly portion of meat, at which Ross
looked dubiously.</p>

<p>"You&#8217;ve given us so much already," he hesitated.</p>

<p>Waymart interrupted. "Jerk it," he directed
briefly. "Jerked meat makes a good stew when
ye can&#8217;t git no fresh meat." He turned sharply
to Weimer in his bunk. "See here, Uncle Jake,
have ye forgot how t&#8217; jerk venison?"</p>

<p>Weimer crawled out of his bunk, scowling.
"Vell, I haf nicht dat. I guess I jerk him so
gud as anypody."</p>

<p>"Get about it then!" retorted Waymart with
rough kindness. "Here&#8217;s a meat knife to shred
it up with."</p>

<p>He laid a large, sharp knife on the table, and
cut Ross&#8217;s thanks short by an abrupt departure.</p>

<p>Weimer, grumbling at the interruption to his
rest, cut the meat in long, thin strips, which, he
told Ross, were to be nailed to the outside of the
shack after the storm had passed. But in the
morning, Ross, objecting to a process which
brought the meat into contact with the dirty
logs, stretched a cord between two trees, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
over it, in the sunshine, folded the strips clothespin
fashion, leaving them for the air to cure and
dry.</p>

<p>For two or three days the McKenzies did not
visit their neighbors. Ross saw them outside
their shack occasionally, and something in the
air and attitudes spoke, even at that distance, of
disagreement.</p>

<p>One evening at six o&#8217;clock Weimer stumbled
out of the tunnel alone and down the path, the
darkness robbing the snow of its terrors. A few
moments later, Ross, having laid the dry sticks in
the drilled holes in the end wall of the tunnel,
lighted the fuses, and, candle in hand, made for
the mouth.</p>

<p>He came out on Lon Weston sitting on a stump
which projected above the dump.</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc," greeted Lon Weston.</p>

<p>"Hello, Weston." Ross was so astonished to see
him there that he nearly forgot to count the explosions
that just then thundered in the tunnel behind
him.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, five." That accounted
for the five sticks.</p>

<p>He leaned against the tool house, and looked at
Lon through the dusk. Lon&#8217;s cap was pulled
down over his eyes. His sheepskin collar was
turned up, meeting the cap. All that was visible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
of his face was a bit of beard protruding around
the stem of the pipe. But the voice sounded a
more amiable note than it ever had in the stage
camp, although his manner revealed an uneasy
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Well, Doc, how d&#8217;ye like minin&#8217;?"</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t like it at all," replied Ross honestly.</p>

<p>"Seems t&#8217; like you all right," returned Lon.
"You&#8217;re in better flesh and color than you was
down on Dry Creek."</p>

<p>"So are you," retorted Ross, laughing.</p>

<p>Lon made no reply. He moved restlessly.</p>

<p>"Done any studyin&#8217; in that pile o&#8217; books ye had
along?" he asked abruptly after a time.</p>

<p>"No." Ross&#8217;s tone was crisp. "Haven&#8217;t
studied a word." The subject was a tender one
with him.</p>

<p>There ensued a pause. Ross opened the door of
the tool house, and threw in his pick and shovel.
He hitched the legs of his high rubber boots
nearer his body; and then, as Lon made no move
toward going, he swung his numbed hands briskly.</p>

<p>"I thought," Lon began again in a constrained
and hesitating way, "that you was mighty anxious
about those books. I thought your goin&#8217; to some
college or other depended on your gettin&#8217; outside
of those books."</p>

<p>Ross struck his hands rapidly together. "I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
can&#8217;t study," he answered briefly. "I get too
tired working."</p>

<p>Weston arose and faced toward the cabin of the
McKenzies.</p>

<p>"Another storm comin&#8217;," he announced. "Get
here day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s Christmas," muttered Ross. His heart
contracted sharply, and a homesick pang assailed
him. In his ignorance, before leaving home, he
had set Christmas as the date of his return.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A CALAMITY BEFALLS ROSS</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Ross</span> was writing to Dr. and Mrs. Grant. He
bent over the rough table under the light of two
candles stuck into the logs above his head. Weimer
slept in his bunk the sound and noisy sleep
of a tired laborer.</p>

<p>"At the rate we&#8217;re going at present," Ross wrote,
"we&#8217;ll finish work by the middle of May....
We have at least one thing to be thankful for in our
tunnel. We&#8217;re not obliged to timber it. Of course,
blasting through solid rock isn&#8217;t easy nor fast
work, but I guess in the long run we get along
faster than we would through dirt. In this case,
you see we should be obliged to snake logs down
from the mountainside and build side walls and
roof in the tunnel for our own safety. How&#8217;s
&#8217;snaking&#8217; for you, Aunt Anne? First time I
heard it I hadn&#8217;t an idea what it meant, but it
covers the process of cutting down trees and getting
them to their destination. Tell you what!
We speak some language up here. The King&#8217;s
English isn&#8217;t always in it, but then every one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
understands, and I have fallen into using it as easily
as a fish takes to water. And I am getting hardened
to the work and the weather. I wouldn&#8217;t
mind the whole thing so much now if only the
way to Miners&#8217; Camp would remain open. But
any day it may become practically impassable, and
then I cannot hear from you nor you from me for
months. That&#8211;as I look ahead&#8211;is the tough
part of it, being cooped up here with only five of
us; and how the McKenzies can remain without
laying in more provisions I don&#8217;t see. They have
meat enough, but that&#8217;s all. With this letter I&#8217;m
taking another over to Camp for Leslie&#8217;s father. I
ought to have sent him word before that Leslie
hasn&#8217;t been seen nor heard of since he disappeared,
but every day I&#8217;ve looked for him back&#8211;the
whole affair worries me a lot&#8211;I should think as
soon as he gets my letter, old man Quinn would
come and hunt Leslie up himself."</p>

<p>At this point there was the sound of laughter
outside, and Ross laid aside his pencil and pad.</p>

<p>"Sandy," he muttered, listening.</p>

<p>To his surprise it was not Sandy whom the
opening door revealed, but Lon and Waymart,
both in unprecedented high spirits.</p>

<p>"We left Sandy snorin&#8217;," Waymart volunteered.
"He and Uncle Jake ought to bunk in together.
Lon, show Ross how Sandy talks in his sleep."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>Weston sat down, leaned his head back against
the logs, gave one or two passes through his hair,
which left it arranged like Sandy&#8217;s with a lock
falling over his forehead; and in an instant, although
Weston was dark and Sandy fair, an excellent
imitation of the latter mumbled and talked
and snored against the logs. Weston accurately
and easily imitated the voice and manner of Sandy
with his laugh and every facial characteristic.
Even Weimer rolled over in his bunk and laughed.
Next, Weston, carried out of himself by an appreciative
audience, imitated Waymart, the sheep-herder
at Dry Creek, and finally Ross himself, and did it
all with amazing success.</p>

<p>Ross, convulsed with laughter, rocked back and
forth on his box. It was the first real fun he had
encountered since leaving Pennsylvania. It did
not seem possible that this Weston was the same
half-sullen, wholly silent man whom he had nursed
at the stage camp.</p>

<p>Ross sat opposite the window in front of which
Weston was performing; and finally, just as
Waymart had called for an imitation of Weimer,
the boy, glancing up, encountered Sandy&#8217;s face
outside the dirty pane. It remained there but an
instant while Sandy took the measure of the performer,
but that instant was enough to show Ross
the full expression of which he had caught glimpses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
before, and which revealed the side of his character
that Sandy usually concealed. His blue eyes
glinted angrily. His thin lips, tightly closed,
wore a cruel expression, while every feature clearly
showed a malignant disapproval of Weston&#8217;s
methods of entertainment.</p>

<p>The laugh died in Ross&#8217;s throat; but the next
instant the door swung open and Sandy entered,
gay and careless&#8211;except as to eyes. They still
glinted.</p>

<p>"Thought ye&#8217;d shook me, didn&#8217;t ye?" he asked
with a grin. "Wall, this racket would bring a
feller up from his grave, to say nothin&#8217; of a little
snooze."</p>

<p>He pushed a box over on its side, and sat astride
it; and at once the atmosphere in the cabin
changed, and became frigid, despite the newcomer&#8217;s
gaiety. Weston slunk back to his seat, and all
Ross&#8217;s urging proved ineffectual to draw him out
of his shell again. Waymart&#8217;s face also lost its
good humor.</p>

<p>Presently the three left together.</p>

<p>Weimer, wide awake, moved around the shack.</p>

<p>"Dat Veston!" he chuckled. "How many
kinds of beoples ist he? I could shut mine eyes
and tink he vas dem all."</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and early in the
morning in the teeth of a mild wind and threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
storm Ross was off for Miners&#8217; Camp. As far as
the shoulder around Crosby he went on snow-shoes.
Arrived at the shoulder, and, making use
of the long, sharp spike which he carried, he
picked his way cautiously forward, pushing
through the deep snow in the trail with his feet
and knees, the spike set on the outer edge to prevent
his slipping. Again and again a ledge of
overhanging snow would break away and fall on
him; and, light even as the snow yet was, its
weight dropping on his shoulders caused him to
stagger. The snow-shoes also became a burden,
for they were a useless encumbrance until he
reached the foot of the mountain and struck out
for Steele&#8217;s shack over two miles of snow already
five feet deep.</p>

<p>When he reached Gale&#8217;s Ridge, he was almost
exhausted, not only from pushing through the
snow on the trail, but from the unaccustomed
effort of walking on snow-shoes. Already he was
dreading the most difficult task of all&#8211;the return
journey.</p>

<p>Steele met him with a manifest uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Grant, your trips down to Camp this season
are numbered," he cautioned as they sat down to
an early dinner. "An old trailer could creep
around the shoulder of Crosby for a little while
yet, but neither you nor I could do it in safety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
The snow&#8217;s gettin&#8217; so almighty deep now, and
blowin&#8217; up in ledges on the shoulder&#8211;you probably
got a ducking coming over?" His tone
arose inquiringly.</p>

<p>Ross nodded. "Several times a lot of snow
dropped on me; once I almost lost my balance."</p>

<p>Steele moved uneasily. "That&#8217;s the trouble
with that trail even before there&#8217;s danger of a
regular avalanche. You&#8217;re likely to get swept
over when you least expect it, and going back is
worse than coming."</p>

<p>Directly after dinner Ross commenced to bind
on his snow-shoes for an early departure, having
filled his pockets with candy for Weimer. His
heart was heavy, and he had a queer, choky sensation
as he looked around the little shack, which
he might not see again in months.</p>

<p>Steele was adjusting the straps on his own snow-shoes.</p>

<p>"Going up the cañon with me, are you?" asked
Ross.</p>

<p>Steele nodded, and got into his top-coat. "A
little way," he answered briefly.</p>

<p>Although it was only one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon,
twilight had fallen. The clouds rolled up
the cañon so low that they hung almost within
reach of the men&#8217;s hands, although not much snow
was yet falling. An indescribable gloom filled the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
cañon, the gloom of utter isolation and loneliness.
Not a breath of wind was stirring; not a movement
of a tree was audible. Everywhere were the
deep snow, the silent trees, the great white hulks
of the mountains; and over all the clouds glowered
sullenly.</p>

<p>Nature had erected sudden and impenetrable
barriers in all directions, and Ross felt as though
he were striving against them all.</p>

<p>In silence the two traveled the distance which
lay between Gale&#8217;s Ridge and the upper end of
Miners&#8217; Camp, which was at present a deserted
end. When they passed out of sight of the eating
house on Gale&#8217;s Ridge, they left behind them every
sign of life. The Mountain Company had shut
down two weeks before. A few men had gone to
Steele, but the majority had betaken themselves
"below." Their shacks stood as the owners had
left them, with their stoves, their crude furniture,
and in some cases provisions, intact.</p>

<p>The stage was due now only once a week, and
the post-office had been removed to Steele&#8217;s cabin.
The former postmaster had gone to work on a
ranch on the Grey Bull, leaving the post-office
doors wide open, the snow filling the cabin and
banking up against the letter boxes.</p>

<p>"By April," said Steele, "you can&#8217;t see even the
roof of a single one of these places down here next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
the river. They&#8217;ll all be plumb covered with
snow."</p>

<p>Steele did not stop, as Ross supposed he would,
at the foot of Crosby, but started up the trail.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" demanded the boy.</p>

<p>The superintendent went on. His reply came
back muffled by the heavy air. "Around the
shoulder of this little hill."</p>

<p>Nor could any protest from Ross restrain him.</p>

<p>As they began the ascent, Ross found the moisture
hanging in drops to his clothing, while his face
felt as though it were being bathed in ice-water.
At the same time the clouds settled all about them.</p>

<p>"This is literally walking with our heads in the
clouds," muttered Steele grimly. "And this is
the weather that&#8217;ll pack the snow in this trail with
a crust as hard as earth&#8211;ugh!"</p>

<p>They ascended the trail laboriously, Steele in
the lead, Ross lagging behind, leg-weary, and
heavy-hearted at the thought of the months to
come. Around the shoulder of the mountain they
cautiously felt their way, the thick clouds about
them seeming to press back the banks of snow
above.</p>

<p>Once on the safe trail beyond the shoulder
Steele turned, and held out his hand without a
word. Also wordless, Ross gripped it. Then the
older man took the back trail, and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>The boy stood where the other left him, staring
into the clouds which hid the shoulder. As he
stood, a slight breeze touched his cheek and died
away. He buckled his snow-shoes on again, and
faced Meadow Creek Valley. As he did so, the
breeze came again. Presently it turned into a
wind, and the clouds retreated hastily up the
mountainside. Great flakes of snow filled the air.
Faster and faster they came swirling down until
the air was thick with a storm which cut sharply
against Ross&#8217;s face. He hurried on, and in an
hour was beyond the reach of the storm in Weimer&#8217;s
shack, drying his wet coat and cap.</p>

<p>He found his old partner half wild with anxiety.</p>

<p>"If you did not come pack to-night," he cried,
"I thought you would never! A plizzard ist
now."</p>

<p>So rejoiced was Uncle Jake at Ross&#8217;s return that
he sat near the fire and waxed garrulous while the
wind lashed the trees and drove the snow outside;
and Ross, the other side of the stove, shivered and
listened listlessly.</p>

<p>"What ails you, hein?" Weimer finally demanded.</p>

<p>And Ross, with a lump in his throat of which
he was not ashamed, told him.</p>

<p>"Ach!" exclaimed Weimer disgustedly. He
snapped his thumb and finger together. "I vas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
here dree vinters alone mit no one near. Py day
I vorked. Py night dem volves howl und cayotes;
but," consolingly, "dey can&#8217;t git in, und
dey vant nicht to git in."</p>

<p>Then for the first time he went on to relate to
Ross in his quaint and broken English many
stories of those lonely winters in this solitary valley,
which had then held him as its only inhabitant.</p>

<p>"No wonder," thought Ross, listening to the
fury of the storm, "that the old man&#8217;s mind was
ready to give away under the additional trial of
an attack of snow-blindness."</p>

<p>The blizzard continued in unabated fury all the
next day. Neither Weimer nor Ross visited the
tunnel. They remained housed, watching the
snow gradually pile itself around the little shack
until the two small windows were obscured, and
they were obliged to resort to candle-light.</p>

<p>But during the night the wind changed, and the
following morning the sun rose in a brilliantly blue
sky. Directly after an early breakfast Ross started
to shovel a way out of the cabin. He dug the
snow away from the door and windows, and then
turned his attention to the trail leading to the tunnel.
Here he found that the wind had favored him,
sweeping the path clean and filling up the hollows.
In the valley the snow lay seven feet deep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>Ross worked his way to the ore-dump, at the
base of which he paused to look down on the McKenzies.
Their cabin was also released from the
snow as to door and window. The snow was also
tramped and shoveled around the discovery hole,
but no one was in sight, and Ross had turned again
to his task when a yell caused him again to face
the McKenzie cabin.</p>

<p>Sandy was gesticulating frantically while he advanced
rapidly on snow-shoes, dodging the trees
as he came diagonally across the mountainside.
He came on, talking at the top of his voice, but all
Ross could catch was "sticks" and "thief" and
"trail." Sandy was plainly excited. His neckerchief
was knotted under one ear; his coat was buttoned
up awry; his cap was on with one ear-flap
dangling, and the other held fast by the rim of the
cap. His ears and nose were scarlet, the thermometer
registering, that morning, thirty below
zero.</p>

<p>"Our dynamite is gone," Sandy yelled when he
was near enough to make Ross understand. "Gone&#8211;stolen."</p>

<p>Ross stared at him stupidly. "Who is there to
take it?"</p>

<p>"Some one," panted Sandy with an oath, "must
have come up the trail Sunday and taken the stuff,
thinkin&#8217; that it &#8217;ud storm right off and shut up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
trail so none of us &#8217;ud be such fools as t&#8217; go over t&#8217;
Camp after more. That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;ve figured it
out, and I lay ye I&#8217;m right."</p>

<p>"When did you find out the sticks were gone?"
asked Ross with an interest which did not as yet
reach beyond Sandy.</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago," gasped Sandy. "I come
as fast as I could to see if your<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross cut him short with a loud exclamation, and
without waiting to hear the end of the sentence
turned and plunged up over the dump, ploughing
and fighting his way through the snow as though
it were a thing of life.</p>

<p>Sandy picked up the wooden shovel which the
boy had cast away, and followed out of breath, but
still talking.</p>

<p>"You know we kept the sticks in a box under
a hemlock right above the hole, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross, unheeding, floundered across the dump,
and began to dig wildly at the tool-house door, only
the upper part of which was visible. With set
teeth he dug, forgetting Sandy, forgetting the
shovel, his common sense swallowed up in a panic
of fear.</p>

<p>Weimer had always kept the dynamite sticks in
a box, a large double boarded and heavily lidded
affair which was set in the corner of the tool chest
furthest from the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>At first Ross had raised the lid of this box with
chills creeping down his spine. His hair had
stirred under his cap when he first saw Weimer
stuff the sticks carelessly into his pocket and enter
the tunnel. But familiarity with the use of the
sticks had robbed them of their terror, although
Ross was always cautious in the handling.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Doc." Sandy&#8217;s voice at his elbow
finally brought the frantic boy to his senses. "Ye
can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; with yer hands. Stand aside
there, and I&#8217;ll shovel the snow away from the
door."</p>

<p>Ross stood back, unconscious of the nip of the
cold on his nose and cheeks, and watched Sandy
shoveling with a will, the while talking consolingly.</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t believe the thieves have come anigh ye;
don&#8217;t look so, anyway. It&#8217;s likely some one who&#8217;s
a grudge against some of us. There&#8217;s plenty holds
grudges agin Lon. Wisht he&#8217;d stayed in the valley&#8211;here
ye be! Ketch a holt of this side of the
door. Now, one, two, three!"</p>

<p>The door yielded to their combined efforts, and
Ross rushed in with Sandy at his heels. His fingers
were so numbed he could scarcely raise the lid
of the dynamite box. A film seemed to cover his
eyes, and in the light which entered grudgingly
only by way of the door he could see nothing. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
bent his head further over the box, but it was Sandy&#8217;s
voice which confirmed his worst fears.</p>

<p>"Not a stick left. They&#8217;ve made a clean sweep
of Medder Creek Valley!"</p>

<p>The film cleared from Ross&#8217;s eyes, but not from
his brain. The box was empty&#8211;the box which
had contained the stuff absolutely necessary to the
work in the tunnel.</p>

<p>Ross glanced up and met Sandy&#8217;s eyes. Sandy&#8217;s
eyes looked steadily and guilelessly into Ross&#8217;s,
and Sandy&#8217;s face expressed all the sympathy and
commiseration of which Ross stood in need.</p>

<p>The boy sat down on the edge of the box.
"What shall I do?" he asked, his thoughts in a
whirl.</p>

<p>"Do about th&#8217; same as we&#8217;ve got t&#8217;&#8211;git out!"
quoth Sandy with a lugubrious shake of his head.
"Here we got Lon up here t&#8217; help push our work,
and now we&#8217;re up a stump; for ye know"&#8211;here
Sandy&#8217;s eyes held Ross&#8217;s while he spoke slowly&#8211;"there&#8217;s
no use thinkin&#8217; about gittin&#8217; any over
from Camp. No one &#8217;ud be crazy enough to resk
packin&#8217; a load of sticks around the shoulder this
time of year."</p>

<p>Ross shivered as he thought of the shoulder
under its body of snow.</p>

<p>"When are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," answered Sandy promptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
"We&#8217;ll start then, but we&#8217;ll have to shovel
through. You&#8217;ll have t&#8217; lead Weimer, won&#8217;t ye?"</p>

<p>Ross swallowed twice before he answered.
"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"We&#8217;ll help ye." Sandy&#8217;s tones were good-natured
and soothing. He seemed suddenly to
have lost all regret at the disappearance of his
store of dynamite. "We&#8217;ll break open the trail,
and then we can rope ourselves together around
the shoulder. That&#8217;s safer."</p>

<p>"All right," Ross heard himself say in an unnatural
voice. He could not in an instant adjust
himself to this radical uprooting of his plans.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;ll be a ticklish job," Sandy continued, "t&#8217;
break through around the shoulder without
bringin&#8217; down the hull side of old Crosby on
us, includin&#8217; a few rocks; but every day now we
put it off is so much the worse."</p>

<p>He turned to go. "Then we&#8217;ll pick ye up in
the mornin&#8217;; will we?"</p>

<p>"Why&#8211;I suppose so," returned Ross. "There
doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything else to do."</p>

<p>"Better not load up much," warned Sandy;
"and don&#8217;t give Uncle Jake a load at all. All
we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to try to pack over is a little venison."</p>

<p>Then Sandy disappeared, and Ross suddenly
recovered from his mental numbness. It was the
sting of anger which aroused him. So confused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
and disappointed had he been, and so well had
Sandy played his part, that the true solution of
the theft did not dawn on the boy until the other&#8217;s
departure. Then he stopped short on the downward
trail and uttered an exclamation, his hands
clinching inside his mittens, and his eyes narrowing
and flashing.</p>

<p>Of course, it was Sandy&#8217;s own brain which had
planned the matter and Sandy&#8217;s own henchmen
who had made off with the sticks. They had taken
this way of stopping the progress of work in the
tunnel. They had waited until no more dynamite
could be brought over the trail, calculating that
when the time came for the claims to be patented
one half year&#8217;s work would be undone, and then!</p>

<p>Ross started blindly down the path. He would
go over to the Camp with the McKenzies. He
would go down to Meeteetse with them&#8211;no officer
of the law could be found nearer, and there he
would put them all under arrest. Here he stopped
again. Arrest them on what evidence? Face to
face with this question, he was obliged to acknowledge
the neatness of the scheme which had for its
first point the theft of their own sticks. Could
he prove that no one had come over the trail after
he reached the valley? And could he prove that
the dynamite had not been taken by this mythical
some one?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>Ross thought of what Steele had said concerning
trusting Sandy with his pocketbook. Sandy would
have the contents of the purse, Steele said, but he&#8217;d
take care to get them in such a way that he could
shake hands afterward with the owner, as well as
face any jury.</p>

<p>"And Steele," Ross muttered, drawing a long
breath, "was right."</p>

<p>The news of the loss seemed to jar Weimer back
into a semblance of his former intelligence. Instead
of ranting as Ross expected he would he sat
down and talked over the situation reasonably
with his young partner. It was Weimer, in fact,
who restored something like hope to Ross.</p>

<p>He objected to leaving the valley with the
McKenzies. He had been over that valley and
the surrounding mountains inch by inch, he told
Ross. Let that "consarned gang" be gone. They
two would stay and bring the dynamite to light.
Then he told of place after place on the mountain
which would make excellent hiding-places for the
sticks. There were many caves, and some of them
dry. Weimer reasoned the "gang" would cache
the sticks in a dry place for their own future use.</p>

<p>Temporarily the old partner and the young
changed places, and, as Ross listened, he became
stout of heart once more.</p>

<p>"Of course," he exclaimed, "if dynamite can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
be carried up the trail, neither can it be taken back
into Camp. It&#8217;s got to be somewhere around here;
and, if we hunt for it a month, we can still get the
work done in time."</p>

<p>"Vy didn&#8217;t I tink of dem sticks?" Weimer
asked angrily. "I might know dem consarned
gang pe up to somet&#8217;ing ven dey see our vork it
vas gettin&#8217; fast! Vy didn&#8217;t I tink?"</p>

<p>Ross, having lapsed into his own thoughts,
made no reply; and Weimer arose from the box
where he had been sitting, and crawled into his
bunk.</p>

<p>Ross paced the floor slowly, his arms folded behind
him. Ross&#8217;s fighting blood was up. Before
this he had looked at his work as the result of his
father&#8217;s request. It was not to his liking, and the
only actual pleasure he took in it was the prospect
of finishing it. He had believed before the theft
of the sticks that he would welcome anything
which really necessitated his leaving Meadow
Creek Valley, although he would accept nothing
less than necessity.</p>

<p>But this theft seemed suddenly to have made
the work his own and the failure to accomplish it
a personal defeat. Instead of rejoicing over the
prospect of leaving Meadow Creek Valley he welcomed
eagerly Weimer&#8217;s suggestion that they stay
and hunt for the dynamite, even though the hunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
meant that, dynamite or no dynamite, they must
be shut up in the valley for months to come.</p>

<p>Suddenly a new fear caused him to scramble
hastily into his coat, cap, and mittens.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;m going to fetch the tools down," he explained
grimly. "I&#8217;m not going to risk having
some one make off with them!"</p>

<p>"Dat ist so," assented Weimer. "Ve vill need
dose tools; ve vill. Dose McKenzie gang vill see.
I can find dose sticks, und I know I can."</p>

<p>None of the McKenzies came over that evening,
to Ross&#8217;s relief, for the events of the day had
brought a new fear of that outfit. Sandy&#8217;s good-natured
neighborliness had deceived him. Now
for the first time he realized that they were actual
enemies, ready to stoop to any means within the
law to baffle him.</p>

<p>It was scarcely daylight the following morning,
although breakfast in the Weimer cabin had been
disposed of, before there was heard a tramp of feet
outside through the creaking snow, and Sandy
with a heavy pack on his back appeared at the
door.</p>

<p>"All ready t&#8217; strike the trail?" he asked, putting
his head inside the shack.</p>

<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence, during which
Sandy&#8217;s face changed as he looked quickly from
Ross to Weimer. The latter sat beside the table,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
his head resting on his hand, his elbow on the
boards.</p>

<p>Ross answered, "We can&#8217;t get ready to go so
quickly."</p>

<p>For a moment Sandy&#8217;s face was the face which
had appeared at the window the night Weston was
indulging in mimicry, but for a moment only.
Then he rallied and assumed an air of concerned
astonishment.</p>

<p>"What? Not ready? Why, man alive, yer
chance may be gone if ye wait another day. Uncle
Jake, you ought to know that, if Doc here don&#8217;t.
Why, we&#8217;re afraid we can&#8217;t come it even by ropin&#8217;
together. Better hustle up and come."</p>

<p>Both Weimer and Ross sat still, and after a little
further parley Waymart called angrily:</p>

<p>"Hike along here, Sandy. Guess they know
what they want t&#8217; do better &#8217;n you do. Make
tracks here!"</p>

<p>The three "made tracks," while Ross stood and
watched them out of sight.</p>

<p>But after they had gone the boy, uneasy lest
they should return to do the tunnel some damage,
climbed the trail and entered the tool house. The
house was fastened between two trees which
grew at one side of the dump, the side furthest
from the trail across the mountain toward Miners&#8217;
Camp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>Ross had entered aimlessly after assuring himself
that the door at the mouth of the tunnel had
not been opened. He stood silently looking out
of a crack down on the mass of snow which glistened
at the foot of the dump, when he was startled
by seeing Sandy on snow-shoes creep around the
dump and look up.</p>

<p>Only a glance upward did Sandy give, and
them, turning, disappeared. Yet his face had appeared
anxious before that upward glance, while
afterward there was on it a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>The hours that followed were anxious ones for
the two remaining in Meadow Creek Valley.
They began a hunt for the dynamite as soon as
the McKenzies had disappeared. Starting at the
McKenzie shack and discovery hole they widened
the search in a circle which finally included the
valley and the sides of the adjoining mountains,
with a single important omission; it did not occur
to either of them to examine their own premises
further than to assure themselves that neither tool
house nor tunnel had suffered any damage from
their "friends the enemy."</p>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock came the first signs of dusk and,
discouraged, the partners moved slowly across the
valley. Half-way across, Ross chanced to glance
up at the stovepipe projecting from the roof of
their shack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>"A fire!" he shouted. "Look there, Uncle
Jake! Some one has built up the fire!"</p>

<p>At that instant the door swung open and Leslie
Quinn stood in the doorway.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SEARCH</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Over</span> fried bacon, sour dough bread and varied
"canned goods," Leslie told his story to an
interested and excited audience of two. The day
of Ross&#8217;s arrest he had shouldered a pack of stuff
selected from the trunk which still stood under
the new third bunk, waited until twilight so that
he could not be seen on the trail, and then, on
snow-shoes, had made his way over Crosby and up
Wood River cañon to Wilson&#8217;s cabin on the coal
claims.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, a flush sweeping over his
face, "I supposed father was at Cody, and I
wouldn&#8217;t have faced him without that five hundred
dollars for all the gold that may be in these
mountains, and, besides, the way he had taken to
get even with me&#8211;well, I don&#8217;t need to say how
it cuts!" Here Leslie bent over his plate in shame.
"Although&#8211;I&#8211;well, of course, I deserve it, but I
didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d go as far as that."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Less!" Ross jumped up from the
table so suddenly that the box on which he had
been sitting was knocked over. "Here&#8217;s a letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
to you in my care. It has been here so long I had
forgotten it."</p>

<p>He pulled the emergency chest from under his
bunk and produced both of Mr. Quinn&#8217;s letters&#8211;the
one to himself and the one yet unopened.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he exclaimed, tossing both
across the table. "I take it from what your
father says in mine that he thought of the arrest
not as a punishment, but as the way in which he
could be sure of getting his hands on you quickly
in Omaha."</p>

<p>Eagerly Leslie read both letters, his troubled
face lighting and softening. "You&#8217;re right," he
said finally in a low tone. "I guess dad is&#8211;is more
all right than&#8211;than I used to think. I&#8217;ve been
no end of an idiot, frankly."</p>

<p>He folded his letter and slipped it into his
slicker pocket while Weimer urged:</p>

<p>"You was mit dot shack, und dey found you
not, hein?"</p>

<p>"But I want to hear about Ross&#8217;s<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted Ross. "Finish out your
story first. Mine will look like thirty cents at the
end of yours. I&#8217;m not exactly proud of myself."</p>

<p>"Vilson&#8217;s shack," prompted Weimer, pushing
his plate back and planting both elbows on the
table.</p>

<p>Leslie continued his story in a new exuberance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
of spirits, occasionally fingering the letter in his
pocket. He had foreseen that Wilson&#8217;s shack
would be searched, and so, trusting to the drifting
snow to conceal his trail, he had, during the night,
packed provisions into one of the many deserted
shacks in the upper camp. He had selected one
overlooking the trail up Crosby. It had two
rooms, one behind the other, the back room having
an outside door and but one small window.
Leaving the first room undisturbed, he had stowed
his provisions in the back room, which also contained
a bunk.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that it was hard sledding for
me until after the sheriff and the McKenzies came
and went that day," he continued ruefully. "I
had brought along my blankets, but I didn&#8217;t dare
light a fire, and I nearly froze and nearly starved
on cold canned stuff. But after the sheriff had
gone back&#8211;you see I could watch the camp from
the back room window&#8211;and the McKenzies had
passed the shack on the trail over here, I hung
blankets over the windows and had a fire nights
when the smoke wouldn&#8217;t be seen. I could cook
at night and early in the morning and so got along
fairly well. But I expected them all back again
for another search, so mornings I used to vacate
the outside room and leave it the same as it had
been."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>"Why didn&#8217;t you come over sooner?" asked
Ross.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t you see that I couldn&#8217;t," demanded
Leslie, "so long as the McKenzies were here? I
knew, though, that they had told Wilson that they
were not going to stay all winter. They told him
they would go to Cody as soon as they thought
the Crosby trail was getting dangerous. So I
watched that trail like a cat for them to go and
for my chance to get here."</p>

<p>"Vilson he vent out," interrupted Weimer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Jake, I saw him go, but I lay low.
I was afraid of the consequences of being seen. I
had no idea that father had been put off. I was
sure he would come on himself, and I knew that
if father once struck my trail he&#8217;d unearth me.
He never gives up."</p>

<p>"Then, this morning<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" prompted Ross.</p>

<p>"Yes, this morning when I saw the McKenzies
coming down the trail bag and baggage, I humped
myself to get ready to get over here before their
tracks got filled up. I knew that if they could
get one way I could get the other way to-day, but
maybe not to-morrow. And I tell you what,"
here Leslie arose and stretched out his arms,
"I&#8217;ve been living these weeks as close and cramped
a prisoner as I ever want to be. I could get out
nights a little because the camp came to be about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
deserted, but I was cooped up all day in the
shack."</p>

<p>Far into the night the boys talked, while
Weimer alternately listened and dozed. When
Ross was well launched on the story of his arrest
he became at once embarrassed, wondering how
he was going to evade the matter of Lon Weston
and the note. He finally compromised by ending
the story of his capture in a partial account of his
conversation with Sandy in the barroom of "The
Irma," and Leslie, taking it for granted that his
father&#8217;s name and address came from Sandy, did
not ask embarrassing questions.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s as I suspected, then," he added slowly.
"The McKenzies were probably employed on the
ranches around home at some time. The cowboys
and sheep-herders are always coming into the
town, and probably they all knew me by sight,
while I didn&#8217;t know them one from another."</p>

<p>Ross checked the question which arose to his
lips concerning the fourth man that Mr. Quinn
was after, and shortly after, the boys tumbled
into their bunks, Ross with a feeling of deep relief
that the third bunk would be occupied during
the winter.</p>

<p>"I didn&#8217;t do so badly in Cody after all, as it has
all turned out," he thought comfortably as he fell
asleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>He was only half awakened a few moments
later by an exclamation from the third bunk,
and heard Leslie say, "By the way, Ross,
who was<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" then the question, "Are you
asleep?"</p>

<p>Ross, without replying, sank into a deeper
sleep, and Leslie said no more. Weimer was already
snoring.</p>

<p>The following morning Ross tumbled out at
daybreak and built a roaring fire in the old
cracked heater. He glanced at the third bunk
and began whistling cheerfully. Perhaps they
could find the dynamite now that there was a
second with sound eyes to aid in the search and
a sound brain to help plan. If only the sticks
could be found the early spring would see the
work completed and the claims patented.</p>

<p>The first thing Weimer did when he arose was
to go to the door and survey sky and mountains
with practiced eye, as he sniffed the bracing air.
The sky was overcast and lowering, while a sharp
wind drove the snow in eddies and drifts through
the valley.</p>

<p>"Der vill pe a pig storm mit us," he prophesied;
"it ist on its vay. It vill get here in dree, four
days."</p>

<p>"Hear that, Less?" shouted Ross at the new
bunk. "You turn out and we&#8217;ll be off. We&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
got to unearth that dynamite before any more
snow piles up here around us."</p>

<p>Leslie left his bunk with a bound. "I&#8217;m good
for it. How&#8217;s breakfast? When I filled up last
night I thought I&#8217;d never need anything more
and here I am as hollow as a drum!"</p>

<p>At the breakfast table, he suddenly bethought
himself of the question he had meant to ask the
previous night. "I say, Doc," he exclaimed,
"who was the third man with the McKenzies
yesterday? My cabin wasn&#8217;t near enough the
trail so that I could see."</p>

<p>Ross hesitated and Weimer answered, "Dot vas
a cousin of the McKenzies, name of Lon Veston."</p>

<p>There was a clatter and a fall as knife and fork
slipped out of Leslie&#8217;s hands. "Lon Weston!" he
ejaculated. "Lon Weston here? A cousin of the
McKenzies?"</p>

<p>"Know him?" asked Ross.</p>

<p>Leslie picked up his fork. "Know Lon? Well,
I should say so. He&#8217;s made trouble enough at
home<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" He bit his lips suddenly and stopped,
adding, "He was foreman on a ranch near North
Bend for a couple of years. He&#8211;he used to come
to our house a good deal."</p>

<p>In a flash Ross recalled the photo that had
dropped out of Weston&#8217;s pocket at Sagehen Roost,
the pretty girl face, and instantly he knew why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
Hank had said of Leslie when he rode away with
Wilson, "Seems as if I&#8217;d seen that there young
feller before."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are surely brother and sister," Ross
decided, his gaze fixed critically on Leslie&#8217;s downcast
face. "They look tremendously alike."</p>

<p>"Veston, he vas de man dot Doc here mended,"
Weimer volunteered. "Doc vas at Dry Creek mit
Veston."</p>

<p>Leslie glanced quickly across the table. "Not
the man who was there when I passed through&#8211;the
day I was with Wilson&#8211;not that one, Ross?"</p>

<p>"The same," nodded Ross. "He&#8217;s the Lon
Weston that I know."</p>

<p>"Then he isn&#8217;t the Lon Weston that I know,"
said Leslie with conviction and also relief. "That
man at Dry Creek had dark hair, while the ranch
foreman had hair as light almost as Sandy&#8217;s. Not
the same at all."</p>

<p>And because of the note at "The Irma," Ross did
not contradict Leslie, did not tell him that Weston&#8217;s
hair was still light beneath its dye of chestnut
brown.</p>

<p>"But some day," he thought, "I can ask him
about the fourth man that his father is after, and
so find out about Weston in a roundabout way."</p>

<p>But the search for the dynamite soon proved so
strenuous that all thought of the crime committed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
on the North Fork faded from Ross&#8217;s mind. Day
after day the boys continued the search while
Weimer stayed in the cabin "rustling grub" and
giving suggestions. The theft of the sticks seemed
to have shocked the man into something of his
former mental keenness and industry. Not once
did Ross have to urge him to his household tasks.
When the boys tramped into the cabin at noon or
long after darkness had fallen, they found a hearty
appetizing meal prepared, the cook even going to
the length of objecting to their washing the
dishes.</p>

<p>"If you dem sticks find," he would say, "Ich
vill stay mit dese dishes."</p>

<p>"Uncle Jake," exclaimed Ross at noon the third
day of the hunt, "I&#8217;m discouraged. We have
poked into every spot for miles around where such
a lot of dynamite could be hidden&#8211;and then have
gone again."</p>

<p>"I&#8217;m almost ready to believe," declared Leslie,
"that the boys had the sticks in their packs when
they left."</p>

<p>Weimer shook his head. "No, never would
dose poys pe so foolish. Dose sticks are here, hein?
Somewhere in Meadow Creek Valley ve vill find
dem," but the old man&#8217;s voice broke on the declaration.</p>

<p>"Of course it couldn&#8217;t be that the McKenzies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
carried them away," affirmed Ross. "If there had
been six men of them they couldn&#8217;t have carried
away all the dynamite that we had and Wilson
had and they had. In fact they couldn&#8217;t have carried
it all very far that night and in the teeth of
the awful storm that howled among these peaks.
I believe with Uncle Jake that the stuff is in this
valley."</p>

<p>"You see, Uncle Jake," Ross began after a pause,
"we have gone on the supposition that they chose
a spot under the cover of rocks or in hollow trees,
some place where the dynamite would be kept dry.
Now, it may be that they have dug a hole in the
snow and ice, and buried it in the open, and the
snow has drifted over its grave."</p>

<p>"Maype! maype!" Weimer ejaculated. "Put,
if dey haf, our goose, it ist cooked."</p>

<p>He pushed the box on which he sat back against
the wall.</p>

<p>Ross opened the cabin door, and looked out.
The weather had grown warmer. The blanket of
clouds which had hovered over the earth for days
had lifted and the snow lay dazzling in the strong
light. When he closed the door, Weimer had
donned his blue goggles.</p>

<p>"Where&#8217;s your big storm, Uncle Jake?" asked
Ross.</p>

<p>"Comin&#8217;, comin&#8217;," answered Uncle Jake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
confidently. "It vill pe on us py mornin&#8217;. Dis light
it vill not last."</p>

<p>Ross sat down and took his head in his hands,
his elbows on his knees.</p>

<p>"Every fall of snow," he thought, "makes our
work so much more hopeless."</p>

<p>Presently Weimer broke the silence. "Vell,"
he began meditatively, "ve haf t&#8217;ings to eat fer
de vinter, anyvay," and Ross understood the circle
around which Uncle Jake&#8217;s thoughts had been
winding.</p>

<p>"Yes, it&#8217;s Meadow Creek for us now, whether
the dynamite is found or not." Ross&#8217;s voice was
grim. "We went over on the trail as far as the
shoulder of Crosby to-day and whew! Uncle Jake,
it was a sight to see. The wind has packed the
snow into that trail until it hangs over the gorge
in great masses and curls."</p>

<p>"Looks," added Leslie, "as though a thousand
tons or so might sweep down over the shoulder any
minute. The trail is closed all right as far as I&#8217;m
concerned. If I hadn&#8217;t come in the McKenzies&#8217; footprints
that morning I wouldn&#8217;t have come at all."</p>

<p>After dinner the boys fastened on their snow-shoes
outside the door and then looked questioningly
at each other.</p>

<p>"Well&#8211;where to now?" asked Leslie despondently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>"Sure enough&#8211;where?" returned Ross equally
despondent.</p>

<p>Weimer had offered no suggestions, and the boys
were at the end of their resources.</p>

<p>"We&#8217;ve hunted every place," said Ross absently,
adjusting a buckle on the strap of his snow-shoe,
"except our own premises here."</p>

<p>No sooner had he heard his own voice speaking
these careless words than their possible significance
struck him. He sprang up with kindling eyes.
"Less, do you hear?" he shouted, his thoughts in
advance of his tongue. "There&#8217;s where it may be,
and maybe that was the reason why Sandy came
back and looked. Hurry! Hurry up!"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" yelled Leslie as
Ross raced awkwardly around the cabin on his
snow-shoes.</p>

<p>Weimer opened the door and peered out through
his colored goggles. "Has dot poy gone crazy?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Leslie, without pausing to answer, hurried after
Ross. "Where to?" he yelled.</p>

<p>"The tool house," returned Ross over his shoulder.
"It&#8217;s fastened between two trees, and hangs
out over the foot of the dump! See?"</p>

<p>But, instead of taking the trail to the tunnel,
Ross struck across the mounds and hillocks and
drifts of snow that blocked the trail leading to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
Miners&#8217; Camp. Through the tangle of pines and
hemlocks he led the way until he stopped at the
foot of the snow-heaped dump and looked up at
the tool house, one side of which rested on the
dump, while the opposite side was fastened to
sturdy hemlocks whose trunks arose from the
débris heaped about them from the tunnel. The
tool house was now a shapeless white form, while
the dump was buried beneath tons of snow.</p>

<p>"It was here," Ross explained breathlessly,
"that Sandy stood. I was looking out at the
McKenzies from a crack up in the house. He
came back and looked up under the house and
then grinned and went back to the others. They
had started to leave, you know. Now why did he
want to look under that house?"</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s it!" cried Leslie with excited conviction.
"They had cached the stuff under the
house and he wanted to make sure that their trail
could not be seen. Ross, the sticks are up under
there, high and dry."</p>

<p>"You bet!" shouted Ross turning in his tracks.
"We&#8217;ll get shovels and dig for it. And, Less, if
we find the cache, we&#8217;ll let off one blast around
here outside of the tunnel that &#8217;ill show them, if
they&#8217;re still over in Camp, that we ain&#8217;t dead yet."</p>

<p>"Nor dumb and stupid, either!" cried Leslie
delightedly as he legged it rapidly over the snow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>In the door of the shack they found Weimer
still standing, shielding his eyes with one hand
and calling questions into space. The boys, appearing,
stopped to answer, not only satisfying the
old man but receiving a valuable suggestion.</p>

<p>"Vat for you dig mit all dot vork? It vill dake
you poys a day und a half to git up unter dot
shack. Vy not go in und raise dot floor und find
dem sticks unter?"</p>

<p>Leslie tossed up his cap. "Three cheers for
Uncle Jake!" he shouted. "That&#8217;s the very
thing to do. We&#8217;ll get around to that signal blast
sooner. Come on, Ross!"</p>

<p>It was Leslie who led this time, axe in hand,
while Ross followed with hammer and shovel.
The trail to the tunnel had been unused for days
and was so deeply drifted that the boys had difficulty
in getting up to the dump even with the aid
of the shovel. Once on top they were obliged to
shovel their way slowly into the tool house.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Ross when they were fairly
in, "now for work with these floor boards!"</p>

<p>Leslie, with many grunts, fell to clearing away
the snow from the floor, while Ross pulled the big
box in which the dynamite had been stored from
the center of the shack into one corner.</p>

<p>"See here, Ross," cried Leslie excitedly as he
bent to the last shovelful of snow. "We don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
need axe nor hammer. The McKenzies have done
the work for us. The floor has been taken up and
just laid back again without being spiked down.
That box held the planks down pretty firmly, you
see."</p>

<p>The floor consisted of halves of tree trunks, flat
above and rounded on the under side. Eagerly
Ross and Leslie raised the central plank and both
cried out simultaneously, for the dynamite filled
the space beneath up to the level of the floor.</p>

<p>"And to think!" muttered Ross, "that I have
not thought of this before&#8211;didn&#8217;t think of it
when I saw Sandy peering up here."</p>

<p>Leslie sat back on his heels and mopped his
face. "Pretty cute of &#8217;em to think of a thing like
this," he conceded. "I should have taken the
sticks as far away as I could have carried them had
I been doing it, and considered that the farther I
went the better for my plans."</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s Sandy," declared Ross. "Steele has told
me a dozen times that he&#8217;s the brains of the
clan."</p>

<p>It did not take the trio long to restore the dynamite
to its box, for Ross, going down to the cabin,
led a delighted Weimer through the sunshine up
to the tool house, and Weimer willingly devoted
his great strength to the task.</p>

<p>"And," insisted Leslie when their task was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
completed, "now for putting the shot that shall tell
Miners&#8217; Camp that we&#8217;re livelier than ever over
here."</p>

<p>As long as the trail was closed and the McKenzies
could not return, the boys reasoned, it would
be a lark to inform them in this way of the failure
of their project.</p>

<p>"Even if they have gone on to Cody," suggested
Ross, "Bill Travers might get the news to &#8217;em by
way of the stages."</p>

<p>"But you see," ruefully from Leslie, "probably
there&#8217;s no one except themselves that knows of
our plight. They may not have told any one of
the theft of the sticks."</p>

<p>"Well, we&#8217;ll set off a blast that will tell every
one that they&#8217;re found, anyway!" retorted Ross.
"And we&#8217;ll do it in the morning before the storm
comes on," for the brilliancy of the sunlight had
long been dimmed by heavy banks of clouds rolling
in from the northwest.</p>

<p>Weimer entered into the project with the abandon
of a child, and it was he who suggested the location
of the "shot."</p>

<p>"Nicht on Crosby," he said shaking his head.
"Dot might upset dot tunnel. Put it mit Soapweed
Ledge und see vat comes."</p>

<p>The boys did not ask what Weimer meant.
Anything they did not understand they laid to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
his "Dutch lingo," but they immediately adopted
the suggestion concerning Soapweed Ledge, and in
the morning carried enough sticks across the valley
to plant a respectable "mine," as Ross called it, beneath
one of the huge rocks which jutted out from
the side of the mountain that bounded the valley
on the north. This mountain rose four thousand
feet above Meadow Creek, its head lost in the snow
clouds that now threatened to submerge the valley.
On the face of the mountain lay a great body of
snow, especially heavy above the timber-line, which
here, because of the great elevation of the valley
itself, was only a few hundred feet above the base
of any mountain.</p>

<p>Weimer, lured out of the shack by the dimness
of the light and the enjoyment of the undertaking,
went with the boys and did his share in the "packing"
of the sticks unurged. It was he who, with
an accession of unusual keenness, planted the
charge in a shallow cave with a mass of rock
perilously overhanging the entrance.</p>

<p>"Ve vant ein noise," he chuckled, "ein pig
racket. It shall pe heard in Miners&#8217;."</p>

<p>A few moments later they had the noise, all
they had planned for, and then a noise that no
one had foreseen save Weimer, and he had not explained
his expectations.</p>

<p>While the long fuse was burning, the three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
spectators had retreated to the middle of the
valley and faced about expectantly. There came
a fearful detonation which awakened the echoes
on every hand and the vast rock with a dozen of
its neighbors was lifted like lumps of clay and
hurled into the valley amid a cloud of snow and
ice. Some of the fragments landed almost at the
feet of the spectators.</p>

<p>The echoes had not died away before Weimer,
yelling, "Ve may not pe out of de vay far,"
turned and made his clumsy but rapid way on
snow-shoes further from the scene of the explosion.
The boys were following him blindly
and excitedly when, in the clouds fairly over
their heads, came a sound that neither had ever
heard before, a wrenching, grinding, tearing sound
which caused Ross&#8217;s hair to stir under his cap.</p>

<p>"Can th-that be thunder?" he stammered running.</p>

<p>Weimer looked over his shoulder at the mountain.
"You haf neber an avalanche seen, hein!"
he cried, and stopping, faced the other way again.</p>

<p>Down into view below the low hanging clouds
it swept its terrible way, that avalanche which the
trembling of the mountain had caused, the work
of the dynamite. With a swift overwhelming
rush it crumbled the rocks and, uprooting great
trees, bore them easily on its bosom. Into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
valley it debouched, carrying with it the wreckage
from the mountainside.</p>

<p>Ross and Leslie looked at each other with white
faces when the roar and grind and rush finally
ceased.</p>

<p>"Suppose," suggested Ross huskily, "we had
set that blast off on old Crosby."</p>

<p>Both boys looked at the mountain overhanging
the tunnel above their shack, and Ross shivered.</p>

<p>"It would have been good-bye to the tunnel and
the shack and us too, I guess," muttered Leslie.</p>

<p>"I told you," declared Weimer, "vat vould
happen, hein? I told you last nicht. Now ein
avalanche you haf seen."</p>

<p>Neither boy contradicted his first statement.
With the last they agreed rather breathlessly,
for an avalanche they surely had seen!</p>

<p>"I hope," said Ross carelessly as they entered
their shack, "that the McKenzies are still in
Miners&#8217; and that they heard that blast!"</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PERILOUS JOURNEY</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> following morning the three inhabitants of
Meadow Creek Valley began work again in the
tunnel. The air was filled with a smother of
snow which fell unaccompanied by wind. When,
the following day, the sky cleared, over the path
of the avalanche and over the ruins of Soapweed
Ledge lay a concealing blanket of snow three feet
deep.</p>

<p>"Whew!" shivered Ross as he led the goggled
Weimer over the snow to the tunnel that morning.
"Wish we had a thermometer up here. This is
some cold. Must be minus zero by a long way."</p>

<p>"Mine nose ist my thermometer," complained
Weimer, rubbing that whitening member. "Aber
dis weather it holds nicht. Anoder snow falls in
dree, four days."</p>

<p>The third day proved the truth of this prophecy.
The atmosphere became many degrees warmer and
the sky lowering.</p>

<p>"More snow," sighed Leslie, looking over the
silent, white sheeted valley with homesick eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>"Und den more," added Weimer complacently.
"More und more till June."</p>

<p>That noon it chanced that Weimer, being
afflicted with a headache, left the tunnel early.
A little later, Ross, pushing the little car out to
the dump, called back to Leslie at work with the
drill:</p>

<p>"Guess I&#8217;ll go down and rustle the grub for
Uncle Jake. That headache of his is genuine."</p>

<p>"All right," assented Leslie, "I&#8217;ll be down in
half an hour or so. I want to put this shot before
I go."</p>

<p>Ross found Weimer in a state of great excitement,
the headache forgotten. He stood at the
door of the shack, peering up toward the tunnel,
both hands shielding his blinking eyes.</p>

<p>"Who vas dot man?" he demanded in a high,
eager voice.</p>

<p>"What man, Uncle Jake?" Ross stopped short,
staring at Weimer as though he were bereft of his
senses.</p>

<p>"I see him!" declared Weimer. "He vas shust
startin&#8217; up dot trail py de tunnel. I see his pack.
He vore ein pag on it. He vore ein cap mit
goggles. I see him."</p>

<p>Ross looked up the mountainside incredulously.
"Why, Uncle Jake, I just left the tunnel and there
was no one there but Leslie. I guess," jocosely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
"your headache has made you &#8217;see things at
night,&#8217; hasn&#8217;t it? No one can get into the valley
now, you know."</p>

<p>Excitedly protesting and expostulating, half in
English and half in German, Uncle Jake retreated
inside the door, and taking up his position beside
one of the little windows watched the trail to
the tunnel while Ross, smiling at his partner&#8217;s
hallucination, built up the fire, cheerfully banging
the covers of the stove as he filled the fire-box
with dry pine sticks. In the midst of this racket
there entered the sound of crunching footsteps on
the side opposite the shack from that occupied by
Weimer.</p>

<p>"Hein!" yelled the latter springing up. "Was
sagen sie? It ist somepody!"</p>

<p>A rap thundered on the door, and it was thrust
open at the same time unceremoniously, while a
low, gruff voice inquired abruptly:</p>

<p>"Is there a young doctor here?"</p>

<p>A man a little above medium height stood on
the threshold. He wore buckskin trousers and a
buckskin coat over a heavy sweater, giving him a
bulky appearance. He had on snow-shoes, and
strapped over his shoulder, a large leather game
pouch sagged. Behind smoked goggles his eyes
were blinking, like Weimer&#8217;s, almost closed. His
head and ears were covered with a shaggy fur cap,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
which met his turned-up coat collar. His face
was smooth above a fringe of black stubby whiskers,
which ran from ear to ear under the chin.
His voice, though gruff, was not unpleasant as he
explained.</p>

<p>"Of course &#8217;twas a month and more ago since
they told me over t&#8217; Red Lodge that<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" His
eyes fell on Ross. "You&#8217;re him they call Doc
Tenderfoot, ain&#8217;t ye?"</p>

<p>"Why&#8211;yes," answered Ross. There was a
pause between the two words caused by the
speaker&#8217;s amazement at seeing a man drop in
from&#8211;where?</p>

<p>"Come in," invited Weimer, "und set down."</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t care if I do," assented the stranger.</p>

<p>He unbuckled his snow-shoes, and, leaving them
outside, entered the shack. Turning down his
coat collar, he loosened his cap, pushing it back
on his head, thereby revealing the ends of short
black hair.</p>

<p>"Haf you peen up to dat tunnel, hein?" demanded
Weimer with a triumphant glance at
Ross.</p>

<p>The stranger nodded, "Yep. Didn&#8217;t see no
signs of livin&#8217; here and I did see some signs up t&#8217;
the mouth of the tunnel, but I didn&#8217;t see no good
way of gittin&#8217; up t&#8217; it. When I got there I was
over t&#8217; other side of the dump and when I got up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
on top of it I heard voices down here, so down
here I put agin!"</p>

<p>"Did you come up from Miners&#8217; Camp?" asked
Ross eagerly.</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head. "No, I live
toward the Divide on<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" The stranger interrupted
himself to ask, "Know the country over
there, do you?"</p>

<p>Weimer shook his head. "Only py hearsay."</p>

<p>"Well, we located on Sagewood Run, my pal
and me, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Didn&#8217;t know dere vas a soul livin&#8217; in dem
parts," exclaimed Weimer.</p>

<p>"Me and my pal," returned the stranger. "We
hain&#8217;t got no neighbor near enough to throw
kisses to, that&#8217;s sartain. You&#8217;re the nighest."</p>

<p>"Prospector?" asked Weimer.</p>

<p>"Coal," returned the stranger. "We&#8217;re tryin&#8217;
to hold down half a dozen claims."</p>

<p>He turned from Weimer, and changed the subject
in his queer, abrupt way.</p>

<p>"Pard&#8217;s sick&#8211;hurt. Guess he&#8217;ll pass up his
checks afore long if he don&#8217;t git help."</p>

<p>He squinted through his goggles at Ross. "Over
t&#8217; Red Lodge they said you fixed up a feller down
in Dry Creek good&#8217;s new. So I come after ye fer
a couple of days."</p>

<p>Instantly Weimer became alarmed. "Ross, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
can&#8217;t go und leave us, hein! When the sun pe
shinin&#8217;, I can&#8217;t get &#8217;round. Ross, he must pe
here to work. He can&#8217;t go mit you."</p>

<p>Ross drew a long, perplexed breath, and said
nothing. The stranger looked attentively at
Weimer for the first time.</p>

<p>"Got a touch of the sun, too, have ye?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Weimer removed his goggles, and pressed his
hands over his eyes. "Yah, dot I has, a touch
und more dan a touch. Ross here, he ain&#8217;t leavin&#8217;
us to go mit you."</p>

<p>Still Ross stood silent. The stranger made no
response to Weimer&#8217;s protestations, but, bending
forward, regarded him closely.</p>

<p>"What?" he burst out. "Are you Dutch
Weimer?"</p>

<p>"Dot ist vat dey call me," assented Weimer,
turning his bloodshot eyes on the stranger.</p>

<p>The latter persisted in an incredulous voice,
"The Dutch Weimer who used to run a miners&#8217;
supply store down in Butte?"</p>

<p>"Dot same," assented Weimer. "Und who
might you pe?"</p>

<p>The stranger grinned, a one-sided grin which
sent his right cheek up under the smoked goggles.
"Well, Uncle Jake, do you remember a little black-headed
rascal that uster hang his chin on the edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
of yer counter about once a day and get a nickel&#8217;s
worth of candy?"</p>

<p>Weimer wrinkled his brow in perplexity. "Dere
vas so many plack-heads," he muttered, scratching
his head.</p>

<p>The stranger grinned delightedly, and again his
right cheek was pushed up under the goggles.
"Of course there was. I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the only calf running
around loose, I know. Well, do you remember
Marvin Miller?"</p>

<p>"Hein!" cried Weimer. He held out his hand
impulsively. "Und are you Marvin Miller&#8217;s poy?"</p>

<p>"The same," declared the stranger, grasping
the hand. "And didn&#8217;t you have a younger pard
by the name of Grant?"</p>

<p>"Yah!" Weimer fairly shouted. "Dot I did,
and he&#8217;s my pard yet."</p>

<p>"Uster git his eyes about shut, and tighten his
lips, when things didn&#8217;t go to suit &#8217;im," grinned
Marvin Miller&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s my father all right!" cried Ross.</p>

<p>The stranger drew back and whistled. "Your
dad!" he exclaimed. "Sho, now; that&#8217;s not so?"</p>

<p>"It ist so," Weimer broke in. "His fader sends
him to help me mit der vork in dese claims, und
den dis consarned gang of McKenzies go and pack
off der sticks<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" and Weimer was launched on an
account of their troubles, feeling perfectly at home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
with the man who as a boy had hung over his
counter in the old days when he was merchant
and not prospector.</p>

<p>Ross, too, felt his heart warm toward the man
who had known his father; and for an instant the
present faded, and he was back East again among
the old familiar surroundings. He was being
looked over by the father who "got his eyes about
shut" when the son did not please him; he was
being affectionately scolded by Aunt Anne and
advised by Dr. Grant&#8211;but the thought of the
doctor brought Ross up sharply against the purpose
of the stranger&#8217;s visit.</p>

<p>A sick partner, Miller had said: but he, Ross,
also had a sick partner, although the sickness was
more of the mind than the body; and that partner
objected to his going. What should he do? His
training with his uncle would leave him no choice
if he had only himself to consult in the matter.
He was better than no doctor at all, and he was
called on for help; therefore he must obey the
call. But there was Weimer, who had learned to
depend on him, and who, he feared, might relapse
during his absence, however brief, into his former
irresponsible state, for Leslie was, of course, a
stranger to the methods which Ross had been
obliged to employ to keep Weimer busy. Nor
was Leslie, who had acted under Wilson&#8217;s direction,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
accustomed to going ahead with the work as Ross
had been obliged to do. But if the trip would
occupy only a couple of days&#8211;well, he could not
refuse to go.</p>

<p>Here he became conscious that Miller was
addressing him, and that Uncle Jake was leaning
eagerly toward him.</p>

<p>"If Doc here is willin&#8217;," Miller was saying, "we
might go into cahoots this way: If my pard needs
&#8217;im longer than a day &#8217;r two, I&#8217;ll come along back
and buckle down t&#8217; work here &#8217;n&#8217; help you out
while he&#8217;s there a-nussin&#8217;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Yah, yah!" consented Weimer eagerly. "Den
he may mit you go. You could do more vork dan
Doc. You come pack und mit us vork."</p>

<p>Ross, relieved, turned to the peg where hung his
cap. "I&#8217;ll go up to the tunnel and get Leslie,
Uncle Jake, and you take hold of the dinner."</p>

<p>"Leslie," repeated Miller carelessly. "Who&#8217;s
he?"</p>

<p>Ross, leaving Weimer to relate Leslie&#8217;s history,
hurried up to the tunnel. He wanted to see Leslie
alone and give him numerous suggestions and
directions beyond the reach of Weimer&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>"Of course, Less," he ended as the two finally
started toward the shack together, "even if I do
have to stay, and Miller comes back, he won&#8217;t know
how to manage Uncle Jake in case he has a relapse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
into the state that I found him in. And Miller
looks like a strong willing fellow to work, so guess
we won&#8217;t lose anything by my going. Anyway
I&#8217;ve got to go, for he says his partner is in a bad
way." Miller&#8217;s partner, it seemed, had been caught
under a log they were "snaking" down to the
cabin. His arm was crushed and in bad shape.</p>

<p>"Some way, Ross," Leslie burst out uneasily, "I
mightily hate to have you go. I&#8217;ll be deadly lonesome
up here without you even for a couple of
days."</p>

<p>"But if I&#8217;m not back then this Miller will be,"
returned Ross hopefully, "and he shows up rather
agreeably."</p>

<p>After a hasty dinner, Ross selected from his chest
all that he considered would be required. Some
of the articles Miller put into his game pouch,
Ross making up a bundle himself to bind on his
own back and so divide the load. At one o&#8217;clock
they started, with Weimer and Leslie standing in
the doorway, the former urging them on with many
expressions of hope for a speedy return that they
might get ahead of "dose consarned gang."</p>

<p>Ross walked after Miller easily. Those past few
days on the mountainsides had accustomed him to
the use of snow-shoes. Almost in silence they
crossed the valley and began the ascent of what
remained of Soapweed Ledge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>During the last hour the light had faded, and
snow began to fill the air. From the base of the
ledge the cabin on the other valley was barely visible,
and Ross could scarcely make out the figures
standing in front of the door.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miller turned with an exclamation.
"There! I forgot something that I wanted t&#8217; tell
Uncle Jake. Wait here a minute, will ye? It&#8217;ll
not take me long t&#8217; go back."</p>

<p>He walked rapidly over the snow across the valley,
and disappeared into the cabin. Five minutes
passed. He reappeared, and made his way more
slowly back again.</p>

<p>"All right," he shouted from the foot of the
ledge. "Turn to the right, and go along above
them rocks. That&#8217;s the trail."</p>

<p>At the top of the mountain Miller again took
the lead. He had shifted the pouch to the front,
and eased its weight with one hand. Ross noticed
that it seemed much heavier than when he entered
the cabin, but thought nothing further of the
matter.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was on totally unfamiliar
ground among a labyrinth of "sugar loaf" peaks
which they skirted and climbed, Miller pushing on
steadily and without words.</p>

<p>"Hold yer wind," he directed Ross; "ye&#8217;ll have
need of it before we reach camp."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>The sky and earth were nearly blotted out now
by the falling snow. Ross could see scarcely a
dozen paces ahead. He could not tell whether
they were headed east or west, north or south.
They twisted and turned and turned again. The
boy became leg-weary; but Miller pressed on, seemingly
unexhausted, the heavy game pouch dragging
at his shoulder.</p>

<p>"We&#8211;we can&#8217;t reach there to-night, can we?"
Ross gasped at last.</p>

<p>Miller turned his head but did not pause.
"Yep," he answered, "about dark."</p>

<p>Again in silence they went on.</p>

<p>Finally, at five o&#8217;clock, they began to climb the
gentle slope of a mountain which seemed to have
no summit. Here for the first time his guide
stopped to allow Ross to rest. Then he advanced
slowly, step by step, prodding the snow deeply at
the left of the blind trail he was following.</p>

<p>"What&#8217;s the matter?" Ross called the first time
he saw Miller taking measure of the snow in this
way.</p>

<p>"Gorge somewhere here," Miller had replied.
"Wind&#8217;s filled it up even from bank t&#8217; bank. If
we sh&#8217; step off&#8211;why, there&#8217;s a hundred feet or so
below made up of spruces and snow. I don&#8217;t want
t&#8217; go down int&#8217; no such landscape."</p>

<p>Ross involuntarily hugged the upper side of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
mountain. He longed for their journey&#8217;s end. As
they neared the top, the wind became active, cutting
their faces and forcing Ross to turn his back
and gasp for breath.</p>

<p>Then came the descent, the storm thickening
about them. Occasionally Miller threw a direction
or a warning over his shoulder, which always
caused Ross&#8217;s heart to leap fearfully.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t go outside my tracks here. There&#8217;s a
flat rock on the down side that ends in a ledge.
Not a pretty slide t&#8217; take," he shouted once.</p>

<p>Again it was: "Be careful ahead here under
that rock. Brace toward the inside of the trail.
We may get a few pounds of snow on our heads."</p>

<p>For half an hour longer they tramped on steadily.
Ross ached in every muscle. His feet were
beginning to cramp. They almost refused to raise
the snow-shoes and push them forward. Miller
slackened his speed when he saw that Ross was
nearly played out.</p>

<p>"A few minutes more, and we&#8217;re there," he explained.
"Keep up your courage."</p>

<p>And at that moment Ross thought he had need
of courage. They had been descending the mountain
gradually above timber-line, zigzagging back
and forth across the face in such a way as would
enable them to use their snow-shoes to the best advantage.
Now the storm lightened just enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
enable Ross to see they were traveling along the
edge of a cliff with an overhanging fringe of trees,
and the cliff appeared to the boy to be the jumping
off place into space. Right and left as far as
the falling snow permitted him to see the cliff extended.
Above was the white bulk of the mountain;
below was nothing but storm.</p>

<p>Along this cliff Miller had walked slowly, pausing
occasionally to look up into the trees. Finally
he gave a grunt of satisfaction, and, throwing his
staff and the heavy pouch on the rock, took from
the snow-laden branches of a pine a coil of slender
new rope.</p>

<p>"Nerves good?" he asked jokingly.</p>

<p>"For what?" was Ross&#8217;s startled response.</p>

<p>Miller explained. Ross saw that for the first
time the colored goggles were no longer astride the
other&#8217;s nose. His cap was drawn down over his
eyes, however, and his coat collar was turned up so
that not much of his face was visible save his nose.</p>

<p>"If it was summer," began Miller, busying himself
with the rope, "we could get around this here
little rock. But now there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; t&#8217; do but go
over it, because the mountain on each side shelves
down so steep now we couldn&#8217;t git down on snow-shoes
or off &#8217;em to save our necks. We&#8217;d bring
down a load of snow on our heads if we should
try."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>As he talked, he knotted the rope securely
around a tree standing near the edge of the rock.
"Right here the cliff slopes so I can just slide you
down," Miller&#8217;s gruff voice ran on in jerks, "and
then I can slide after ye. But I take it you
ain&#8217;t used to mountains and this sort of game,
and so I guess ye&#8217;d better hitch the end round yer
waist."</p>

<p>He tossed the end of the rope to Ross. "Take off
yer shoes, and pack &#8217;em in your hand," he directed
when with numb, trembling fingers the boy had
knotted the rope. "Forty feet down," Miller continued,
"you&#8217;ll come to a ledge. Stop there, and
free the line."</p>

<p>A moment more, snow-shoes in hand, Ross was
on his back sliding down an almost perpendicular
wall, his hair doing its best to raise his cap from
his head. Slowly he was let down, down, so far
as he could see, into space. Then suddenly, just
as he had closed his eyes in dizzy terror, his feet
struck snow into which he sank to his knees, and
the rope above slackened.</p>

<p>The ledge had stopped him, but it seemed to
Ross but an insecure footing hung between heaven
and earth. It was a mere path across the face of
the cliff not more than three feet wide at the
widest part.</p>

<p>Ross untied the end; and then, as he felt it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
jerked from behind him, he covered his eyes with
his hand and stood shivering, crowding back
against the cliff.</p>

<p>It was the work of a moment only for Miller to
slide down the rope and stand beside him.</p>

<p>"Hug the cliff," directed Ross&#8217;s conductor
shortly, "and follow me. No, don&#8217;t put on your
shoes. I&#8217;ll break the trail fer ye."</p>

<p>Slowly they crawled across the face of the cliff,
the ledge leading downward. At the base they
were in a winding cañon scarcely twenty yards
wide. Here they buckled on their snow-shoes
again.</p>

<p>"If," said Miller, bending over the straps, "we
see it&#8217;s best fer you t&#8217; stay a few days with my pard
and let me go back and help Uncle Jake, I wouldn&#8217;t
do much investigatin&#8217; of the premises around here
if I was you."</p>

<p>Ross shuddered, and looked up at the face of the
cliff, obscured now not only by the storm, but by
the coming darkness.</p>

<p>"No investigating for me!" he exclaimed forcefully.</p>

<p>Then they began the tramp up the cañon, the
shadow from the wooded mountains deepening
every moment. Finally, Miller made a sharp
turn around a group of seven spruces standing at
the foot of a peak, and cautiously approached a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
log shack that stood half buried in the snow, and
had as its corner posts four tall trees. The snow
was shoveled away from the door and window,
and a light smoke arose from the joint of stovepipe
projecting from the roof.</p>

<p>At the door Miller stopped and listened.
"Guess he&#8217;s asleep," he whispered. "Take off yer
shoes out here."</p>

<p>Ross stooped, and unbuckled his snow-shoes.</p>

<p>"Guess the fire must be low," whispered Miller.
"Wisht you&#8217;d go round the corner there, and
load up with wood while I go in and see what he&#8217;s
up to. But don&#8217;t come in till I tell ye to. I&#8217;ll
sort of prepare him to see ye."</p>

<p>Ross did as he was bidden. He found the path
to the pile of pine chunks partly broken; but, with
his numb fingers incased in huge mittens, it was
not easy work to dig out the wood frozen under
its covering of snow. But finally, his arms full,
he staggered around the corner of the shack, and
stood again in front of the door. So busy had he
been at the wood-pile that he had not thought of
listening for sounds within the shack.</p>

<p>Now, as he stood in the dusk before the door, he
was surprised at the stillness within, and also by
the fact that the window beyond the door showed
no light. With a growing but vague uneasiness
he waited, chilled to the bone by the wind, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
had begun to suck through the cañon and whistle
along the sides of the mountains.</p>

<p>The few moments during which he waited
seemed to him like years. Then he raised the
wooden latch softly, and opened the door. Darkness
and silence greeted him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Miller," he whispered.</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Miller!" His voice rose sharply.</p>

<p>The wind soughed through the branches over
his head; and a sharp flurry of snow, forerunner of
the blizzard, assailed him, while from the open
door came a whiff of warmth.</p>

<p>Ross dropped the wood outside, and, stepping
within the shack, closed the door, and groped his
way toward the stove, from the front of which
came a faint glow.</p>

<p>Pulling off his mittens, he held his hands over
the heat, at the same time holding his breath that
he might hear the breathing of the sick man.
But all he heard was the beating of the blood in
his own ears.</p>

<p>Working some life into his fingers, he tore open
the front of his fur-lined coat, and, pulling a match
out of his pocket, lighted it, and held it above his
head. In the further corner of the cabin was a
bunk, from beneath the blankets of which the
straw protruded. Trembling so that he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
scarcely walk, Ross started across the floor. Half-way
to the bunk his match burned out. He
retreated to the stove, and lit another. This time
he succeeded in reaching the bunk. Several
blankets were spread over a foundation of straw.
Otherwise the bunk was empty.</p>

<p>A panic seized Ross. "Miller!" he shouted,
"Miller!"</p>

<p>The wind howled through the cañon. The trees
above the shack swayed and grated their interlocked
branches together.</p>

<p>Striking a third match, Ross observed a candle
stuck into a hole in a piece of wood which lay on
the table. He lighted it, and sank into a chair
beside the table.</p>

<p>What had happened? Where was Miller?
Where was the sick partner?</p>

<p>Ross took off his cap, and laid it on the table.
In bewilderment he ran his fingers through his
hair.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes fell on something in the
shadow beside the door. He went to it. It was
the heavily loaded game pouch. Evidently Miller
had opened the door, dropped that inside, and vanished
into the night.</p>

<p>Ross was reaching for the pouch when another
thought struck him so forcibly that he jerked
himself to a standing posture with a loud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
exclamation. Hastily opening the door, he stopped and,
throwing the wood about, peered through the darkness,
searching the open space where he had parted from Miller.</p>

<p>His snow-shoes were gone.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW CAMP</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> disappearance of the snow-shoes, instead of
proving to Ross that he had been hoaxed, at first,
only deepened his bewilderment. Finally, the
idea found lodgment in his brain that Miller&#8217;s
partner had wandered off in the storm delirious,
and Miller, having found him gone, had followed,
forgetting Ross. The boy was too confused to
weigh the probabilities of such forgetfulness, especially
in view of the missing snow-shoes. Therefore,
the moment the idea occurred to him he acted
on it, hurrying out into the storm with the intention
of going to Miller&#8217;s assistance.</p>

<p>But, without snow-shoes, he found himself helpless.
He had not gone a dozen yards from the
door before he sank half-way to his waist in the
snow. Scrambling hastily back again, he ran
around the cabin where the snow was not so deep,
and struggled up the mountainside.</p>

<p>"Miller!" he shouted desperately. "Miller,
where are you?"</p>

<p>Here and there among the trees he plunged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
frantically until the fear that he could not find his
way to the shack drove him back.</p>

<p>He filled the stove with wood, snuffed the candle
mechanically, and looked about him. Then for the
first time he realized that there was but one bunk.</p>

<p>"If two men lived here, there would be two
bunks," he said slowly; and then came the conviction
that Miller had decoyed him here and deserted
him, taking the snow-shoes along. But
Ross&#8217;s brain was too numb to pursue the thought.
Exhausted by his long tramp and by his fruitless
battle with the snow, he filled the stove with
chunks, closed the draughts, and, without stopping
to blow out the candle, rolled into the bunk, and
was asleep before he had pulled all the blankets
over him.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the shack was filled with a
light, which, although exceedingly dim, was unmistakably
daylight. Outside, the snow was piled
to the top of the window. The candle was burned
out and the fire low. Ross crawled out stiffly,
every muscle aching and sore. Filling the stove,
he looked at his watch. Twelve o&#8217;clock! He had
slept away the morning.</p>

<p>Outside the blizzard raged in unabated fury, but
so sheltered was the shack by scrub hemlocks and
banks of snow roof-high, that but little wind found
its way through the mud-chinked log walls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>Standing over the fire, Ross looked at the dark
outlines of the one bunk, and considered his situation.
His heart sank when he thought of the
miles which Miller and he had put between themselves
and Meadow Creek Valley.</p>

<p>And who was Miller?</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s suspicions, of course, had fastened to the
McKenzies. But why had they considered it necessary
to have him marooned so far from Meadow
Creek? How did they know that the dynamite
had been found? When they left Meadow
Creek<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Ross aloud at this point. He
brought the stove poker down vigorously on top
of the stove. "That blast under Soapweed Ledge!
I wanted &#8217;em to hear it&#8211;guess they didn&#8217;t fail!"
Ruefully he turned from the stove. He was certainly
paying for his little triumph.</p>

<p>But who was Miller?</p>

<p>The lack of wood in the cabin soon turned his
attention from the answer to the necessity for immediate
action. He found a large wooden snow-shovel
behind the stove; and, opening the door
cautiously in order to prevent a mass of snow from
following it, he cleared away a space in front of the
door and the two windows, and shoveled his way
to the wood-pile.</p>

<p>It was not until he was struggling around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
corner of the shack with an armful of wood that
he realized that his weakness and tremors were due
not only to anxiety, but to hunger; and with that
realization came a fear which nearly induced
another panic. Was there food in the cabin? So
great had been his absorption that he had not noticed
the contents of the shack beyond those things
which he had required for immediate use.</p>

<p>Throwing the armful of wood down beside the
stove, he proceeded to make a hurried search, the
results of which quieted his fears. The cabin was
as well stocked with provisions as Weimer&#8217;s. A
portion of these supplies, the canned milk, vegetables,
and fruits, he found in boxes beneath the
bunk. Sacks of flour and meal were suspended
from the roof logs to protect them from the
"pack" rats. Having investigated these provisions,
Ross opened a second door at the back of the
shack, supposing it led out-of-doors. But he was
agreeably surprised to find it led to a little lean-to
of logs, where were suspended a large ham, strips
of bacon, jerked meat, and quantities of fresh venison
all frozen. The door protected these from the
heat inside the shack, while the logs, unchinked,
gave protection from timber wolves and coyotes,
but not from the snow, which had sifted in over
everything.</p>

<p>Ross at once set about getting breakfast. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
found every necessary cooking utensil at hand.
The cabin was&#8211;as such cabins go&#8211;completely
furnished and, it appeared, must have been inhabited
not long ago by a stout man; for in a box
at the head of the bunk he found some clothing
much too large for him or for the man who had
brought him there.</p>

<p>"But," he thought, as he sat down to venison
steak and flapjacks, "whoever owns the cabin,
Miller must have gone from here to Meadow
Creek, because there was a fire here last night
when I came in; and it was a fire fixed to keep
some hours, too."</p>

<p>As he finished eating, his eyes fell on the game
pouch still bulging beside the door. He had not
looked inside. With a piece of steak balanced on
his fork he crossed the floor. Then:</p>

<p>"Books!" he cried aloud. "<i>My</i> books!"</p>

<p>The fork fell from his hand. He dropped to
his knees and emptied the pouch. Besides the
appliances which he had given to Miller to carry
there were all his books, the medical text-books
which he had left in the emergency chest in
Weimer&#8217;s shack. He could scarcely believe his
eyes. He sat back on his heels, and stared.</p>

<p>"Weston!" he finally shouted. "Miller is
Weston!"</p>

<p>Suddenly rising, his eyes narrowed and his lips
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
compressed, he kicked the game pouch across the
floor in a gust of anger caused by an illumination
of certain circumstances which explained the
events of the previous day.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;m slow," he muttered between clinched
teeth. "Any one can get the better of me."</p>

<p>He recalled Weston&#8217;s imitation of different
people the night he and Waymart had come to
Weimer&#8217;s together and Sandy&#8217;s displeasure at the
exhibition. Sitting down in an armchair beside
the table&#8211;the only chair in the shack&#8211;he followed
his chain of evidence link by link. The conversation
which he had overheard between Waymart
and Sandy the night of the latter&#8217;s return from
Cody was fully explained&#8211;the some one whose
assistance they might need in Meadow Creek
Valley, but who would not come unless some one
else had left.</p>

<p>"Weston would not come with Leslie there for
fear he&#8217;d be recognized," thought Ross. "Therefore,
Sandy took steps to remove Leslie and&#8211;yes&#8211;in
spite of the mess I made of it, I blocked the
game!"</p>

<p>Then, despite his anxiety, Ross grinned. Of
course the McKenzies had not expected Leslie to
return any more than they had expected the
dynamite to be found. But after hearing his
signal of discovery they had sent Weston, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
skilful impersonator, to maroon him here&#8211;where?
Ross dropped forward his head on the
table and groaned.</p>

<p>"They brought me here to get rid of me entirely,"
he finished; "and I came voluntarily!"</p>

<p>Presently he picked up the pouch, intending to
hang it on a nail in the logs beside the door. It
was not quite empty; and, lifting the flap he
looked in. At the bottom lay a few wads of newspaper.
Ross concluded that the pouch had been
stuffed with these when Weston came to Weimer&#8217;s.
Then, when he went back after the books, he had
thrown out the paper, the presence of which had
prevented his companion from noticing much
difference in the pouch after the books were put
into it. Ross picked up one of the pieces, and
glanced at it listlessly. It was a page of the Cody
"Gazette." He dropped it back into the pouch.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he told Uncle Jake and Leslie
when he got the books," thought Ross, hanging
up the bag.</p>

<p>Leslie was the only comfort the situation held
for him, and this merely came from the knowledge
that Weimer was not alone. For, of course, Weston
having seen the boy in Meadow Creek would return
and block the work somehow, probably steal the
dynamite again, and convey it farther than the
tool house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>Here Ross started up in a sort of frenzy, and,
putting on his top-coat and cap, rushed out-of-doors.
He would find a way out. There must be a way,
for Miller had gone back&#8211;Ross felt sure he had
returned&#8211;and if Miller had he could! He would
save the claims yet. The first plunge into the
snow, waist-deep now, with the whip-lash of the
blizzard in his face, brought him to his senses.</p>

<p>"This is folly," he thought as he dropped once
more into the chair beside the table, "when I have
no idea where I am."</p>

<p>But, even if he did know, his snow-shoes were
gone; and without them he could not safely
venture&#8211;nor with them, either, he decided, recalling
with a sick shudder the snow-filled ravines
against which Miller had warned him&#8211;<i>Miller</i>,
indeed!</p>

<p>His bitterness came back with a rush. After all
he had done for Weston this was the final reward.
Weston had shaved his beard, recolored his hair
and the fringe of whiskers left beneath his chin,
covered his deep brown eyes with goggles, and
brought his benefactor of Dry Creek here to spend
months in this deadly loneliness! That was the
thanks he gave "Doc Tenderfoot" for saving his
life.</p>

<p>That night the storm ceased and a warm wind
arose. The next morning Ross again shoveled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
out the doorway, window, and wood-pile. The sky
was clear, but the sun did not swing over the
towering peak which rose almost perpendicular,
opposite the cabin, until ten o&#8217;clock. But, when
it did show its face, it looked down on a bewildering
mass of snow. Ross gazed longingly down
the cañon, which wound like a serpent between
the overhanging mountains. Down there not
half a mile away a ledge ran diagonally across
the face of a cliff; and Ross felt impelled to go
to the foot of that cliff, and find out whether or
not the rope still dangled from its summit. But
well he knew that even so short a journey would
be impossible without the aid of snow-shoes.
However, if the warm wind continued and the
sky remained unclouded, perhaps in a day or
two there would be a crust on the snow of sufficient
strength to bear his weight. Then he would
investigate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he tried to force himself calmly to
the business of living and planning. He was
there. So far as he could see there was no escape.
He would make the best and the most of the
months of his banishment. When he arrived at
this conclusion, he found himself relenting a
trifle toward Weston on account of the books. It
had been no light load to pack across the mountains
on a tramp which had lasted many hours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>"Perhaps Weston has a piece of heart, after all,"
Ross mused the following morning, "but so thoroughly
is he under Sandy&#8217;s control that he dare
not show it."</p>

<p>Before him on the table lay Piersol&#8217;s "Histology,"
although he was totally unable to focus
his scattered thoughts on the contents. He was
anxiously watching the weather. The warm
wind had continued, but the sky was lowering.
Another storm was brewing. Finally Ross left
Piersol and going to the door, looked out anxiously
over the cañon.</p>

<p>"The snow is settling finely," he decided, "and
if the cold comes before the storm the crust will
hold me up."</p>

<p>He went back to the armchair and began drumming
nervously on the arms. He wondered how
it had chanced to be packed so far over the
narrow trails. A chair, a "store chair," that is,
was an uncommon sight among the mountains.
From which point had it been brought, Cody or
Red Lodge? The latter, he knew, was more than
one hundred miles from the Shoshones, while
Cody was but eighty.</p>

<p>However, nearness depended not so much on
miles as on accessibility, and for the thousandth
time Ross wondered where he was.</p>

<p>He could not reason from the memory of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
tortuous windings of that stormy afternoon&#8217;s
journey, with no view of the sun&#8217;s face to guide
him; but his strong impression was that he was
many miles northwest of Meadow Creek, with at
least three chains of peaks between him and
Weimer.</p>

<p>Then he fell to wondering again about the
shack. Did it belong to one of the McKenzie
relatives? Who had given it over to his use
for the winter? He suspected that, while the furnishings
and the clothing had been left there by the
owner, the McKenzies had planned for his winter&#8217;s
residence, and had partially, at least, stocked his
larder, as the owner would not be likely to desert
such a supply of meat, especially the fresh venison.
Perhaps the venison was due to Weston&#8217;s forethought.
Ross liked to think that Weston had
done all that he dared do for the comfort of
"Doc Tenderfoot."</p>

<p>"He&#8217;s a bigger man," mused "Doc"; "and yet
he seems more than half afraid of Sandy. Wonder
what the trouble is."</p>

<p>That night the wind changed, the temperature
dropped, and the next morning snow began to
fall, lightly, however. Again and again Ross
went out for trial trips on the fast freezing crust,
but not until afternoon did he venture on the
journey to the cliff.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>The shack stood among the trees on the mountainside
about ten feet above the level of the
cañon. Taking with him a long pole with a
sharpened end, which he found in the shack,
Ross slid from tree to tree until he gained the
level of the cañon. Then, hugging the foot of
the mountain closely, that he might judge of the
lay of the land by the trees, and so avoid the
dreaded creeks and gorges, he turned down the
cañon toward the cliff.</p>

<p>It was difficult walking, the crust being smooth
and slippery. Several times one foot broke
through, and each time Ross&#8217;s heart seemed to
rise in his throat when he considered that he
was walking on a body of snow deeper than he
was high. The cañon had no distinguishing features.
It might have been any one of a dozen
located among the Shoshones, and all of them
unfamiliar to the young man lost in their midst.
On either side, the mountains, dreary and lonely
and lifeless, arose precipitately. It was windless
in the cañon, but on top of the mountains a white,
cold cloud of snow played perpetually.</p>

<p>But Ross&#8217;s eyes were eagerly searching the
mountain at the left for the cliff; and presently
he recognized it despite the curtain of snow drifting
across its face. There it was, stretching up
until his neck ached in the effort to scan the top,
where in an unbroken line along the edge hung
a great body of snow, the undisturbed accumulations
of the last blizzard. The steep side of the
cliff, however, was bare, and Ross failed to discover
a rope dangling over its surface.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/i-308.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
THE SNOW HID IT FROM VIEW
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>He thought he had not expected to see it there,
and so could not account for the sinking of his
heart when he found it gone. For a few moments
he stood looking down the cañon hemmed in by
its great mountain barriers. He fully realized the
fact that he was a prisoner within those barriers,
perfectly helpless until released by the brief summer.</p>

<p>With bent head he turned his back to the cliff
and cautiously retraced his steps while a wildly
whirling "squall" suddenly caught him in its
clutches. He had gone but a short distance before
a sound in the rear caused him to wheel about and
listen sharply. Only a smother of snow, swirling
up the cañon, met his eyes and a blast of the rising
wind his ears. Hesitating, he struggled back a
few steps and turned his face up toward the cliff.
The snow hid it from view. He stood listening
again, and, presently, the sound, above him and a
little in advance, again mingled with the roar of
the wind. Ross broke into a run, panting through
the storm, breaking through the crust, struggling
to his feet and tumbling on again. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
certainly the call of a human voice, although no
words were distinguishable because of the noise of
the wind.</p>

<p>Ross, obsessed by one idea, raised his voice:
"Miller&#8211;Weston!" he yelled frantically. "I&#8217;m
here&#8211;below here! Where are you?"</p>

<p>But the wind swooped down on him, seized his
words and bore them down the cañon. Then it
suddenly died away, and again the snow fell
quietly, mistily, and Ross, looking up, saw, as in a
nightmare, a rope dangling across the face of the
cliff. In bewildered joyousness he pressed his
hand against his eyes and looked again.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s there!" he cried, "but it certainly wasn&#8217;t
ten minutes ago. That&#8217;s the queerest&#8211;I know I
saw straight before<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>He opened his lips to call again, but the call was
checked by the discovery of a man half-way down
the cliff, creeping along on what looked to be a
thread of snow fastened diagonally across the dark
surface of the rock, but which Ross at once recognized
as the narrow ledge he himself had trod
only three days before. Slowly the figure was
progressing, its feet kicking away the snow lodged
on the ledge, its hands clinging to the bare face of
the cliff. Then, faintly into the lull of the storm
a nervous voice floated down to Ross from the
thread-like path.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>"I&#8217;m almost down, I guess, Miller. Hope I can
get to the cabin before another squall strikes us."</p>

<p>Then, from the top of the cliff, the barely distinguishable
words behind the veil of falling
snow, "All right. Remember you&#8217;ll find Doc not
half a mile straight ahead. The cabin&#8217;s on the
right, as I&#8217;ve told ye. It&#8217;s above a bunch of seven
spruces. Ye won&#8217;t need yer snow-shoes&#8211;crust&#8217;ll
hold down there."</p>

<p>Ross waited to hear no more. "Leslie!" he
yelled joyously. "Ho, Leslie! I&#8217;m down here.
Come on! Hurray for that rope again!"</p>

<p>But even as the hurray ascended the side of the
cliff, so did the rope. Snakily, jerkily, the knotted
end traveled upward until it disappeared in the
cloud of snow that hid the mountain tops.</p>

<p>From this cloud came a faint and far-away
voice: "Good luck t&#8217; ye! Tell Doc ye&#8217;re in the
same boat as he is. He&#8217;ll savvy!"</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE INGRATITUDE OF WESTON</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> presence of Leslie without snow-shoes, the
disappearance of the rope, and Weston&#8217;s voice
caused Ross to "savvy" immediately in impotent
anger and bitter disappointment. But not until
the two boys had reached the cabin and Leslie was
warming himself beside the hot stove, did he fully
comprehend the trick that had been played on
him.</p>

<p>"Weston!" he exclaimed stupidly in answer to
Ross&#8217;s explanation. "Why, this isn&#8217;t the man you
told about at Sagehen Roost&#8211;it&#8217;s the Miller that
you went away with. I saw that Weston fellow,
you know. They&#8217;re not the same!"</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s evident that when you&#8217;ve seen Weston
you&#8217;ve seen any number of men that he cares to
imitate. This Miller is Weston, the McKenzies&#8217;
cousin and the man you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" Here Ross checked
himself, as Leslie had not yet connected the dark-haired
Weston with the light-haired Oklahoma
man of the same name.</p>

<p>Finally, after supper, Leslie recovered from his
bewilderment sufficiently to tell connectedly the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>
story of the days that had intervened between
Ross&#8217;s departure from Meadow Creek and his own.</p>

<p>"Begin at the beginning," urged Ross finally,
putting a pine chunk in the stove and snuffing the
candle.</p>

<p>He had seated the newcomer in the armchair
beside the fire, while he sat on an overturned box
in front of the stove door and within reach of a
heap of wood. On the table at his elbow lay the
gun which Steele had insisted on adding to his
equipment the day he arrived in Meadow Creek
and which he had not since touched. Leslie had
brought it strapped across his shoulders and with
it all the ammunition which Steele had provided.
This was another proof of Weston&#8217;s strangely curious
good will that continued to puzzle Ross. How
the unsuspecting Leslie was prevailed on to bring
the limited arsenal was a part of the story which
Ross was demanding. While the storm raged
outside and the dim candle-light flickered and
cast long uncanny shadows within, and the pine
chunk flamed and cracked cheerily filling the
room with a warmth grateful to the chilled narrator,
Leslie complied with the request to "begin at
the beginning."</p>

<p>"I&#8217;d no sooner seen your back, Ross, as you
followed Miller out of the door, than I had an
awfully uncomfortable feeling of responsibility.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
By the time the storm had swallowed you two up,
the whole outfit there at Weimer&#8217;s was sitting
hard on my shoulders. We watched you out of
sight, Uncle Jake and I, and then we went back
into the cabin and, Ross, if that cabin seems to
Uncle Jake now as&#8211;well&#8211;as&#8211;when you left<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Leslie paused and stared at the candle. Ross drew
his seat nearer the stove and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jake has stayed there a lot in the winter
all alone, you must remember. He was telling
me about it not long ago, how the<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Above the cabin, through the roaring and soughing
of the wind among the spruce, came the long
drawn yelling, harassed, pitiful cry of a coyote.
From the cañon the cry was answered. Again
and again the two human-like voices wailed despairingly
at each other while the boys involuntarily
drew nearer together and Ross laid a caressing
hand on the gun and finished his speech:</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s exactly what Uncle Jake told me&#8211;how
the coyotes and wolves prowled around, and he
didn&#8217;t mind them nor the loneliness at all."</p>

<p>Leslie nodded. "I noticed that he didn&#8217;t seem
to mind your being away in the same way I did.
He just took to his pipe and his bunk and seemed
settled for a rest until you got back again. That
didn&#8217;t add any to my restfulness, I can tell you,
for what could I do up in the tunnel without him?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
I rustled around a bit trying to decide what to do
when the door opened and there was Miller again,
or Weston rather. I was as surprised as they
make &#8217;em until he said:</p>

<p>"&#8217;Say, young feller, Doc he sent me back t&#8217;
round up a book on medicine that he may need.
It&#8217;ll be layin&#8217; round loose som&#8217;ers, maybe in that
hair covered chist of hisn.&#8217;"</p>

<p>Leslie went on to say that when he had opened
Ross&#8217;s emergency chest Weston professed to have
forgotten the name of the book he had been directed
to fetch, and, consequently, had taken all the
books, stuffing them carelessly into his game pouch.
Then the storm had again swallowed him up.</p>

<p>"After he went away," said Leslie, "I got to
thinking pretty strongly about the dynamite. If
it was so easy for one man to get into the valley
from the land only knew where, why couldn&#8217;t the
McKenzies make their way back and spirit the
dynamite off for good and all? We&#8217;d gone and
touched off that charge under Soapweed Ledge to
make &#8217;em understand that we had it again, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know!" affirmed Ross grimly. "Geese
that we were!"</p>

<p>"Well, those sticks got on my nerves, and I
made up my mind to fasten them up if such a
thing were possible. So I put on my snow-shoes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
and began to rattle around in the storm to see
what I could do. I thought no one could come up
into the tool house from under because of the mass
of snow all around, and because the dynamite box
was so heavy with all of your and our and the
McKenzies&#8217; sticks in it that it held the floor boards
down with a vengeance. But I wasn&#8217;t taking any
chances after seeing what our &#8217;friends the enemy&#8217;
were capable of doing, so I got all the spike nails
that Weimer had and nailed down the floor. Then
I plowed through the storm up to Wilson&#8217;s shack,
shoveled my way in, collected all the tools that
could be used to pry or hammer with and brought
&#8217;em back to our tool house. And with them, Ross,
I brought a great padlock and chain that I recollected
seeing up there rusty and unused. I oiled
it and put a bar across the tool-house door and
padlocked it. And if I do say it, it would cost a
man some time and strength and racket to get into
that shack. It would also take some tools, and
there&#8217;s none in the valley except what are behind
that locked door, for before night came I had
raided the McKenzie cabin and brought over all
their tools. Then," continued Leslie, "I went to
sleep feeling some better."</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ll bet you," cried Ross eagerly, "that it&#8217;s
because you fastened up the dynamite that you&#8217;re
here! I do believe that when Weston went back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
it would have been easier to cache that if he could
have got it than to have brought you here."</p>

<p>"I don&#8217;t know, Ross." Leslie gave a short laugh.
"It was easy enough to get me here, as easy as to
get you. I&#8211;but you want the story as it comes."</p>

<p>"Every word of it. Go on. The next day<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>The next day, Leslie continued, so furious a
blizzard was raging that he didn&#8217;t work in the
tunnel but spent the time keeping open the trails
to the dump, the wood-pile and the spring. But
the second day, the sky having cleared, he tried
his best to get Weimer to work.</p>

<p>"Ich vill vork mit Doc," was Uncle Jake&#8217;s declaration
of independence, "mit you, nein!"</p>

<p>"You can imagine, Ross, how much work I did
alone, not used to going ahead with the blasting.
When I came down at noon the old fellow had
dished up a capital dinner. He washed the
dishes, but not one step would he budge to the
tunnel. Said that you were likely to drop in any
time that day and he&#8217;d stay in and watch for you.
Said it would be work enough for him to do to
fill you up after your long tramp through the
snow! He simply boiled over with ready excuses.
When I went up to the tunnel I left him with his
goggles on, swinging open the door about once in
two minutes for a look over on Soapweed Ledge.
You know it was clear that day and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>Here Leslie suddenly paused and sat up with a
jerk. He gripped the arms of the chair and gave
a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>"See here, Ross, that clearness business has reminded
me of something that I noticed in the
morning, and, because I thought it couldn&#8217;t be
true, I paid but little attention. But now I know&#8211;well,
this is what it was: when I reached the
dump I glanced across the valley at the McKenzie
shack. It seemed completely buried in snow except
the roof and the chimney stovepipe, and at
first I imagined that I saw heat coming out of that
stovepipe! You know how, after a hot fire, the
heat will crinkle the air above a chimney and no
smoke in sight?"</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s so!" exclaimed Ross. "And you
think<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"At the time I thought it was a mere notion of
mine, but now I believe I saw correctly, and that
Weston was there waiting to dispose of my case."</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s the idea," agreed Ross excitedly. "There
all the time after he left me, probably. He had
likely got him a hot breakfast before you were up
and then let the fire die."</p>

<p>Leslie nodded. "Same as I did when I was
hiding down in Miners&#8217; Camp. But, anyway, I
didn&#8217;t investigate and forgot all about that chimney
until this minute."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>Here Leslie broke off to ask abruptly, "Another
thing, Ross, right here before I forget. The day
you left, you remember Uncle Jake was sick and
you went down to get dinner and left me in the
tunnel?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, only a few minutes after you left I looked
out and you, as I supposed then, stood in the mouth
of the tunnel<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Nope, &#8217;twas Weston," interrupted Ross. "He
said he went up there first. He came to the shack
from that direction."</p>

<p>"Then he got a squint at the work and the dynamite
and your assistant right then! I thought it
was queer I didn&#8217;t get an answer when I yelled to
know if you had dinner ready. But just as I
spoke, the figure took a sneak, and I supposed you
had just stopped a bit to look things over."</p>

<p>"Weston was attending to that, evidently," retorted
Ross promptly. "But now let&#8217;s see&#8211;you&#8217;ve
brought the happenings up to to-day, haven&#8217;t
you?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," Leslie answered. "I&#8217;ll be there in
a minute, though. Yesterday I got as uneasy as
Weimer over your not getting back, and Miller, or
Weston, I mean, not coming as he promised. I
confess I was in a blue funk by afternoon, and I
saw things were shaping for another storm. I went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>
slipping and sliding out beside the dump a dozen
times where I could look over to Soapweed Ledge
while Uncle Jake tramped around outside the
shack continually watching for you."</p>

<p>"Poor Uncle Jake!" muttered Ross stirring uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well, that brings me to to-day," Leslie began
after a pause. "I was down beside the dump looking
for you about eleven o&#8217;clock this morning when
I saw him coming over the Ledge&#8211;Weston, I mean.
Same goggles, same cap drawn down over his ears,
same outfit except the game pouch. I noticed as
soon as he came near that the pouch was gone.
Tell you what, Ross, I made tracks down the trail,
got my snow-shoes on and went to meet him. I
would have hurried to meet a Hottentot! Uncle
Jake stayed behind jabbering in German, and
fairly dancing up and down in his excitement because
you had not come with Weston."</p>

<p>Ross, his elbows on his knees and his chin in his
palms, staring at Leslie, saw in a flash the latter as
he had appeared at Sagehen Roost, overbearing
and dictatorial. Then he saw him running across
the lonely valley of Meadow Creek eager to meet
any one on a fraternal footing.</p>

<p>"Weston must have left his shack and made a
long trip behind it up the mountain and around
over the summit to have come in on the Ledge;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
don&#8217;t you think so?" asked Ross. "He probably
didn&#8217;t want to run any risk of being seen."</p>

<p>Leslie assented and went on with his story. He
had gone to meet Weston with a demand as to
Ross&#8217;s whereabouts and return.</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t ye worry none about Doc," Weston declared
heartily. "He&#8217;s fixin&#8217; things fine over our
way. Doc&#8217;s all right!"</p>

<p>"So he is," Leslie agreed, "and for that reason
we want him right here, Uncle Jake and I!"</p>

<p>"Wall," Weston drawled good-naturedly, "he
says the same about you even t&#8217; wantin&#8217; ye where
he is now for a day."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Leslie asked.</p>

<p>The two had been walking back toward the
shack and the frantic Weimer, and Weston did not
explain until he had assured Uncle Jake of Ross&#8217;s
safety and health, and was seated beside the stove.</p>

<p>"Not once while he was there," Leslie told Ross,
"not even when he was eating dinner, did he take
off his cap&#8211;merely pushed it back a little. Uncle
Jake urged him to shed it, but he just grinned and
said he had a bald spot on the top of his head, and
had got into the habit of wearing his cap all the
time to keep that spot warm. Said he guessed he
wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;bust into that habit now.&#8217; I thought
he was an odd Dick to get into such a habit, and
with a fur cap, too, but it was all so plausible, Ross,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>
everything he said was said with such an air of
truth, that I didn&#8217;t once suspect."</p>

<p>"No more did I," confessed Ross.</p>

<p>"And then, of course, I was awfully interested
in what he had to tell, and ask me to do. He told
a clever lie, Ross. He said that you had brought
down an elk with his gun and wanted me to come
back with him and the sled you had made to help
the McKenzies haul supplies, and help pack the venison
over the mountains for our winter meat. It was
all the more clever because I knew that meat was
all we needed to make our winter&#8217;s supplies good.
The story hit Uncle Jake in the right spot, too. He
hurried up dinner for us to be gone before the big
snow came. Weston thought we could reach his
cabin that night and make it back again to-morrow
morning with the elk meat. He said it would be a
pretty good pull for the three of us, but as there was
a good crust we could make it with that sled. Why,
Doc, there wasn&#8217;t a suspicion of deceit in his manner.
He said you had fixed his pard up all right
and would leave some stuff for him, and so didn&#8217;t
need to stay any longer. So I went up to the tool
house and got the sled out and we started<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"The gun," interrupted Ross. "Did you think
of the gun?"</p>

<p>"Not much I didn&#8217;t! That was Weston. Just
as we were starting off he turned back and said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>"&#8217;See here, young feller. Doc said as how ye
was t&#8217; bring his gun along and mebby he could
bring down a mountain sheep as we come back.
They is a lot of them animals over with us.&#8217;"</p>

<p>So the two had turned back and Leslie strapped
Ross&#8217;s gun across his shoulders. He carried the
ammunition. Weston insisted on taking all of it
along as he and his partner had run short, and
Ross had promised them a share of his! Then
they had started out, and, screened by the veil of
gently falling snow, entered on the same tortuous,
winding, upward trail that Ross and Weston had
taken a few days previously.</p>

<p>"And all the way," Leslie continued, "whenever
the trail let us walk together, he was telling me a
long yarn about the day you and he had spent
chasing that elk whose meat we were going after.
I listened, Ross, with my mouth opened half the
time, and wished a dozen times, if I did once, that
I had been with you.</p>

<p>"Well, as the afternoon passed, the storm became
heavier, and part of the way we couldn&#8217;t see
a dozen feet before us, and finally I think Weston
himself was uncertain of our way although he
said he wasn&#8217;t. It must have been about four
o&#8217;clock when we came to the head of the ledge.
Weston searched and groped along until he came
to a tree where a rope was already tied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>"&#8217;It&#8217;s the one I used fer Doc and me,&#8217;" he explained
and slung it over the cliff.</p>

<p>"He had been hauling the sled along, while all I
had to carry was the gun and ammunition. Now
he said that I had better leave my snow-shoes on top
of the cliff and tie the end of the rope around my
waist and he would let me down to the ledge.
That I was to kick clear of snow and then go up
the cañon and get you to come down and help
heave the sled over and get it down to the cañon.
He said you would know better than I how to do
that. He kept giving me directions about where
to find the cabin, for the snow had thickened until
we couldn&#8217;t see the ledge, to say nothing of the
cañon. You see, Ross, I&#8217;ll confess I was too nervous
about going over into space attached to that
rope to think that his proceeding was queer. I
just didn&#8217;t question a thing, but shut my eyes and
went over. It didn&#8217;t occur to me to wonder why
my snow-shoes, instead of that gun, weren&#8217;t tied
on my shoulders. Well, I struck the ledge and
untied the rope and felt my way along that ticklish
shelf until the squall lifted and then&#8211;you know
the rest. If I live to be a hundred I&#8217;ll never forget
how I felt when that rope was drawn up and
he yelled down that I was to tell you I was in the
same boat that you were!"</p>

<p>It was late and Leslie was too tired to talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>
longer. Ross gave him the bunk and, waiting
only long enough to fill the stove with wood, close
the draughts and blow out the candles, wrapped
up in a blanket and lay down beside the stove, his
coat for a pillow. He did not fall asleep at once,
but lay staring up at the flicker of firelight dancing
about on the mud-chinked logs overhead.</p>

<p>After all his planning and working, he thought,
his mission in the mountains was doomed to failure.
The claims would pass into the McKenzies&#8217;
hands, and, besides, he would have missed one
year of the preparation for the work he had chosen.
He rolled over and half groaned.</p>

<p>"Awake, Ross?" came from the bunk. "I&#8217;m
so tired I haven&#8217;t dropped off yet and, besides&#8211;say,
Ross, here I am and there&#8217;s dad waiting for
me to turn up with that missing five hundred&#8211;and
then your claims&#8211;we&#8217;re not exactly in luck,
are we? I feel as though I&#8217;d like to get my hands
on that Weston-Miller fellow&#8217;s throat."</p>

<p>"There&#8217;s one thing I can do, though&#8211;study,"
muttered Ross. "That I&#8217;ve got to hold myself
to."</p>

<p>Conversation languished then, and both boys
fell asleep, Ross&#8217;s last thought being of Weimer
watching for their return in the lonely valley of
Meadow Creek.</p>

<p>By daylight the following morning the two were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
up, full of plans for living and doing during the
long months of their imprisonment.</p>

<p>"There are some nails, but no hammer," said
Ross. "But we can drive &#8217;em with a stick of
wood and fix up another bunk out of these two
boxes. They&#8217;re the longest, and I think they&#8217;ll fill
the bill for my five feet ten. Then we&#8217;ll divide
the straw and the blankets, and by keeping up the
fire all night, I guess we won&#8217;t freeze to death."</p>

<p>On the floor in the corner back of the stove they
built the bunk. There were not nails enough nor
were the boxes strong enough to allow of making
a substantial bunk such as the owner of the shack
had built against the side logs.</p>

<p>Until the bunk was completed, Leslie, while
working docilely enough under the older boy&#8217;s
direction, regarded the more comfortable bunk as
his permanent possession. He had never been
taught to be unselfish. He had from his motherless
childhood demanded what he wished and
received it until the question arose of his continued
attendance in school. There he had taken
the course he wished and was now paying for it
dearly. It was not until he was dividing the straw
in his bunk and had come across Ross&#8217;s watch
and pocketbook that the idea smote him hard that
the other had vacated the easier bunk in a wordless
generosity that he, Leslie, had never practiced,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span>
and that he had not even thanked the bunk&#8217;s
former occupant.</p>

<p>"See here, Ross," he began brusquely, "you
needn&#8217;t think that you&#8217;re going to rest your old
bones in the new bunk all the time, for you ain&#8217;t!
I shall try it myself half the time."</p>

<p>"Week and week about, then," Ross agreed.
"And this brings us up against a calendar. I
brought my watch, thank fortune! But what
about a calendar? I want to be sure that I know
when the 4th of July gets here, for Steele says
you&#8217;d never know it except by the calendar, there&#8217;s
so much snow."</p>

<p>"Snow!" groaned Leslie. "Snow! There&#8217;s
never a time when there isn&#8217;t snow in these mountains,
it seems. Well, I know what day to-morrow
is, and&#8211;have you a pencil?"</p>

<p>Ross slapped the breast pocket of his slicker.
"Yep, a long one. And there&#8217;s one in the pockets
of the trousers you&#8217;ll find in that box," nodding
toward the repository of the shack owner&#8217;s clothing.
"Guess we will keep a record of the days up
on the side logs. I know how many in each
month when I say that old jingle, &#8217;Thirty days
hath September,&#8217; etc."</p>

<p>But the need of a calendar was not so pressing
as the need of wood. The few days that Ross had
spent in the shack had caused an alarming shrinkage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328'></a>328</span>
in the pile of chunks already cut; and Ross,
commencing to shovel his way to the nearest pine
tree, now ran across a number of logs which had
been "snaked" down the mountainside before the
snow came, and lay ready for the axe and saw.</p>

<p>"I guess if Aunt Anne were here, she&#8217;d not complain
that I took no exercise," he muttered grimly,
shouldering a short cross cut saw.</p>

<p>While he sawed Leslie got dinner. After dinner
Leslie took his turn at the saw and axe while
Ross considered the matter of the calendar. Looking
about the shack, his glance fell on Weston&#8217;s
game pouch. He had hung it on a peg driven between
two side logs and had forgotten it.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" he exclaimed aloud. "We
can mark the days on the margin of the old newspapers
that are in the bottom of that pouch."</p>

<p>Taking the bag down he dumped the crushed
papers out on the table, and sitting down, began to
smooth them out, glancing over the contents idly.
He found nothing which interested him until he
reached the last wad. When he spread this out,
he found, stuck to the newspaper by candle-drippings,
a scrap of coarse note paper which at
once riveted his attention. It contained only the
latter part of one sentence and the first part of
another.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span>
about it, either. If you back out I will turn you
over to old man Quinn<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Over and over Ross read these words. They
were few and short, but to him now they were the
intelligible index to a whole volume. The scrap
was stuck to a "Gazette" bearing a date which was
just previous to Weston&#8217;s appearance in Meadow
Creek. There was no name to show that Sandy
had written the letter, but Ross knew Weston had
escaped from Oklahoma. No doubt Sandy possessed
the knowledge that compelled his obedience.</p>

<p>Ross drew a long breath. "Strange what parts
of two sentences may tell a fellow!"</p>

<p>"Tell a fellow what?" demanded Leslie&#8217;s curious
voice at his elbow. A hand came over his shoulder
and pinned the paper down to the table while
Leslie read the contents aloud.</p>

<p>"&#8217;Old man Quinn,&#8217;" he finished excitedly.
"Why, that is my father, but&#8211;Lon Weston&#8211;say,
what does that mean, Ross?"</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330'></a>330</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A RANDOM SHOT</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> an instant Ross made no reply. He sat
with his back to the door and had not heard Leslie
enter. Turning slowly he looked up with puzzled
eyes.</p>

<p>"Less, there&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve not told you
before&#8211;because&#8211;I guess because I&#8217;ve thought it
wasn&#8217;t fair to tell. But after Weston has brought
us away off here and dumped us in this wilderness&#8211;even
if he has done it out of fear of Sandy&#8211;well,
it seems to me that about now he has forfeited all
right to my silence."</p>

<p>Leslie fell back in astonishment, the scraps of
the letter still in his hand. "Doc, are you getting
luny? What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Ross laughed ruefully. "Just thinking out
loud, that&#8217;s all. Now I&#8217;ll get right down to business
about Weston. You said you knew a fellow in
Oklahoma by his name&#8211;Lon Weston."</p>

<p>Leslie pursed his lips incredulously. "Yes, but
as I said, our Lon Weston had light hair and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span>
didn&#8217;t murder the King&#8217;s English like this man,
and he hadn&#8217;t a husky voice."</p>

<p>"Just so!" cried Ross triumphantly. "Neither
does this Lon Weston murder the English language
when he is talking like himself, nor has he a husky
voice naturally nor has he dark hair! It&#8217;s colored
dark&#8211;near the roots, as I found out, it&#8217;s light."</p>

<p>"Jiminy crickstones!" cried Leslie excitedly.
"If that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s one on me! Come to think of
it, Weston was forever imitating folks, but I never
have seen him in such a serious imitation as this.
How do you know all about him, anyway?"</p>

<p>From this Ross proceeded to tell what he knew
except Weston&#8217;s connection with the note laid
under the electric bulb in the bedroom of "The
Irma." That much he felt himself pledged not to
relate, but its omission, really, in no way detracted
from the proof of Weston&#8217;s identity. Furthermore,
Ross, concerned only with that identity,
began his recital with Sheepy&#8217;s talk about Weston
forgetting the photograph which had revealed the
injured man&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>"You can see," Ross concluded, "by putting
together all the evidence, that he is the fourth
man your father is after, and that Sandy has come
it over him completely, knowing that he is the
fourth. The more I think of it the more I&#8217;m
convinced of Sandy&#8217;s power. Sandy holds this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>
cudgel over his head and makes him do the dirty
work. But, no matter how big the cudgel is, he
had no business to play this low-down trick on us."</p>

<p>"Wait till we get out of here!" declared Leslie
wrathfully, "and I&#8217;ll make him pay for his trick!"
Suddenly his face lighted. "Ross, see here! Dad
has been hunting for that fourth man for two
years, and if I can go to him and tell him who it
is and set him on the right track, well&#8211;I&#8217;ll stand
in better with dad, that&#8217;s all! The five hundred
that I can&#8217;t begin to earn until next summer won&#8217;t
be in it beside that information!"</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as it had come, the light died
out of the boy&#8217;s face. He sat down on the table
and rubbed his forehead in perplexity.</p>

<p>"But, Ross, there&#8217;s another side to this. For
me to do that would knock things endwise with
Sue."</p>

<p>"Sue," repeated Ross, "who is Sue?"</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ve got a sister," explained Leslie. "She&#8217;s
four or five years older. She keeps house for us.
She&#8217;s an awfully good girl, Sue is, although,"
turning his head shamefacedly away, "she&#8217;d be
surprised to hear me say so, for we, dad and I,
have made her a lot of trouble. Dad&#8217;s as up and
down with her as with me and I&#8211;say, Ross, I&#8217;ve
been a nuisance at home!"</p>

<p>Leslie choked. He looked slowly around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span>
cramped, dirty, ill-lighted room, so unlike the
neat, pleasant home presided over by Sue, and
swallowed hard. Ross industriously made notches
in the edge of the table with his pocket-knife.</p>

<p>Finally Leslie, clearing his throat, continued,
"I guess all this serves me about right. I know
I ought to be kicked&#8211;and I am being&#8211;in a way.
Well, it&#8217;s always been up to Sue to put up with us
both, and she has. And then three years ago Lon
Weston came. You see, Ross, dad is a sheep
owner, and North Bend is on the edge of the range
between sheep and cattle, and that always means
war. About three miles away is a cattle ranch,
and Peck, the owner, and dad are always by the
ears. It was at Peck&#8217;s that Lon was foreman, and
he used to come over to North Bend to see my
sister whenever dad would let &#8217;im, but things were
never very smooth for &#8217;em. Of course, I didn&#8217;t
see much of him because I was off at school most
of the year. I was away when the cattlemen had
their big round-up two years ago in the fall.
After each had cut out his own bunch of cattle and
shipped &#8217;em, a lot of the boys went on a drunk
and dad lost his sheep. Naturally he went up in
the air at the loss and was at the throat of every
cattle owner and cowboy for miles around. And,
first thing, of course he came down on Sue about
Lon&#8217;s coming to the house and forbid &#8217;er to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>
him again, not because he suspected Lon, but just
because he was Peck&#8217;s foreman and a cowboy.</p>

<p>"Well, Lon cleared out right off and Sue cried
herself sick. She never said anything, but I&#8217;ve
guessed that Lon never has written to &#8217;er and I&#8217;m
afraid she&#8217;s foolish enough," tolerantly, "to think
a lot of him.</p>

<p>"But I never suspected that Lon was in the
bunch that sent dad&#8217;s sheep over, and I know that
no one else around the ranch suspects it, because
of Lon&#8217;s coming to see Sue right along. Still&#8211;there
were times when he was a pretty rough
customer, and&#8211;it&#8217;s a mixed up mess, ain&#8217;t it, Ross,
along with Sue?"</p>

<p>Ross had been leaning forward on the table listening
eagerly. Two or three times he had started
to interrupt, and had checked himself with difficulty.
Now he burst out:</p>

<p>"I had forgotten the girl&#8217;s photo in Lon&#8217;s
pocket, Leslie. I know now it&#8217;s Sue&#8217;s picture, because
it looks like you. It fell out of his pocket
at Sagehen Roost, and both Hank and I saw it, and
then, when you came, you puzzled Hank because
he thought he had seen you before!"</p>

<p>"The very idea!" exclaimed Leslie indignantly
when Ross had told him about the name on the
photograph. "How dare he carry my sister&#8217;s
picture around with him after doing dad such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span>
dirty trick. Oh, I have it in for him all right! I
don&#8217;t wonder the McKenzies knew they had to get
rid of me before they could make Lon come over
to Meadow Creek! I see now! I presume he
thinks that dad has been on his track these two
years. I wonder if Sandy and Waymart were
with Peck at the same time Lon was?"</p>

<p>For a long time the boys talked over the affair
in all its bearings, and as the long lonely days
passed, they recalled every incident that had occurred
since they left Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.
Their conversations mostly took place in the evening
by the light of one dim candle, or in the
darkness relieved only by the flicker of the firelight,
as candles were not plenty. It was at that
dreary time between day and night with the wind
and the coyotes howling outside that the homesickness
that they could fight successfully in daylight
had its inning.</p>

<p>"But what if I were here alone!" Ross exclaimed
periodically.</p>

<p>His gratitude at having Leslie there softened his
anger at Weston, although he knew that the bringing
of Leslie had been no philanthropic move on
Weston&#8217;s part.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the boys settled to a routine of
work, exercise and study planned by Ross and acquiesced
in by Leslie, all, at first, save the study.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336'></a>336</span>
In that Ross began with no thought of aid from
the other or partnership with him until one day
when he sat with a book on anatomy before him
industriously absorbing the pages. Presently,
turning his book over on its face, he resolutely
closed his eyes against the outer world, and his
ears against Leslie&#8217;s lively whistle, mentally reviewing
the facts he had been conning. Suddenly
Leslie, who had been lying in the bunk, came over
to the table and, picking up the text-book, lazily
bade Ross think aloud.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s so deadly lonely, Ross, with you poring
over those dull books," complained Leslie, "that
I&#8217;d rather hear you recite than not to hear anything
at all!"</p>

<p>From this trifling beginning, a student partnership
grew up. At first the task meant to Leslie
only a form of passing the time away, of hearing a
human voice instead of the crackle of the fire and
the sough of the wind. Then, gradually, his interest
in the subject of anatomy was awakened.
He began to look at himself with a new interest.</p>

<p>"I say, Ross," he burst out one day when he
was frying bacon, "I never have thought of myself
before as being made up of parts that must
work together smoothly&#8211;and I never considered
how they must work and that some one or other
must know just how they ought to work so that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>
he can put &#8217;em together if they fall out of place.
Now, about that femur, and ball and socket joint
at the hip here<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Immediately Ross plunged into a lively description
which soon led both boys to the books for
proof and illustration, and Leslie&#8217;s interest grew.
From being merely the holder of the book while
Ross recited and explained what he had studied,
Leslie, the "hater" of studies, began to study also,
at first, in a fitful way, and then more steadily as
Ross proved himself an enthusiastic teacher.</p>

<p>Neither, however, became so absorbed in his
studies as to become reconciled to his enforced
residence above the seven spruces. Day after day
they ventured out and up and down the cañon, or
up the side of the mountain on the side of which
their shack was located, but no discoveries resulted.
The absence of snow-shoes made travel
impossible except on top of a strong crust, and
even then a realization of a constantly increasing
danger resulted in making such trips shorter and
shorter. The danger was this: blizzard succeeded
blizzard until the willows, ten feet tall, which
grew thickly in the cañon, were completely concealed,
also the scrub hemlocks and quaking asp
on the mountainside. The tops of the bushes,
lashed by the wind until they became finally snow
covered, formed each a dangerous hollow under a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span>
crust thinner and weaker than the surrounding
surface. This painful discovery was made by Leslie.</p>

<p>One bright day, leaving Ross to cut off the
branches of a tree that he had felled for fire-wood,
Leslie took the gun and started down the cañon on
a tour of exploration.</p>

<p>"The crust is stout enough to hold up an ox,
Doc," he declared, bringing the butt of the gun
down on it hard, "and I&#8217;m going out to see what
there is to see&#8211;and shoot."</p>

<p>"Shoot!" echoed Ross, poising the axe in air.
"I&#8217;d like to see something shootable up here beside
coyotes, and we never see them&#8211;only hear &#8217;em!"
and the axe descended with a thud.</p>

<p>Leslie laughed, shouldered the gun and tramped
briskly down the cañon, while Ross wielded the
axe and, whistling cheerfully, thought of the progress
he was making in his studies.</p>

<p>Presently, he rested on his axe handle and
chafed his cheeks and nose briskly with the shaggy
mittens he had found in the box of clothing left in
the shack. "I don&#8217;t want any more frost bites in
mine!" he muttered. He had had several experiences
of the kind that winter, the altitude being
so great that he did not realize the intense cold
until nose or cheek or ear had become frost nipped.</p>

<p>He was resuming his axe when a faint sound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span>
traveled up the cañon on the wings of a slow south
wind. Ross straightened himself and listened.
Again came the wind and the sound. With the
axe in his hand he slipped and slid down the
mountainside until he stood in the cañon below
the seven spruce trees. There he paused long
enough to distinguish in the sound the faint muffled
cry, "Ross!" and "Help!"</p>

<p>"Coming!" yelled Ross frantically. "Where
are you?"</p>

<p>He did not await a reply but, slipping unsteadily
along the icy crust, he hurried down the cañon
in the general direction of Leslie&#8217;s voice, yelling
intermittently, "Coming&#8211;here I am! Where are
you, Less?"</p>

<p>As he came to the cliff over which he had been
lowered into the cañon, he heard Leslie&#8217;s voice
again, still curiously muffled, although evidently
only a little way in advance. It seemed to rise
from beneath the ground.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Ross. Don&#8217;t come fast. I&#8217;ve fallen
through among the willows."</p>

<p>Cautiously Ross advanced toward the voice, testing
the strength of the crust at every step until it
gave under the stamping of his heel. Then he
stopped and found himself looking down a section
of shelving crust into a hole filled with loose snow,
willow tops&#8211;and Leslie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span>"Great guns!" cried Ross. "What are you
doing in there?"</p>

<p>Leslie attempted to respond nonchalantly, but
his face was nearly as white as the bed of snow he
was occupying, and his teeth chattered with cold
and fright.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ve been flopping around here for half an hour
yelling," he explained jerkily, "and have only
managed to sink deeper and break off more crust
and more willow tops."</p>

<p>"Rub your nose and face the next thing you
do," advised Ross immediately, "or you&#8217;ll be a
mass of frost bite."</p>

<p>He rubbed his own nose meditatively. Then
grasping the axe he cried cheerfully, "Hold the
fort a while longer down there, Less, and relief will
arrive. See here! I hadn&#8217;t finished the wood and
I ran off with the axe. Now I&#8217;ll skiddoo and cut a
pole and help you out. And don&#8217;t forget to rub
your face!"</p>

<p>Laboriously and fearfully&#8211;lest he meet with
Leslie&#8217;s fate&#8211;Ross climbed the side of the mountain
until he stood among the branches of a sturdy
spruce, the depth of snow raising him to that
height. Cutting and trimming a long limb, he
dragged it back to the cañon. Projecting one end
over the hole he sat hard on the other. Then Leslie,
by jumping and seizing the projecting end, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341'></a>341</span>
bracing against the sloping sheet of crust, climbed,
breathless but relieved, to the surface of the snow.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Ross," he said emphatically as
they made their way gingerly back to the shack,
"I&#8217;ve done all the research work I want to in this
cañon!" He shivered and slapped his hands
smartly together. "Without snow-shoes we are
helpless here, and the McKenzies know it!"</p>

<p>To make snow-shoes without boards or small
nails or a hammer was impossible to workmen of
their inexperience. They broke up some boxes
and put in all their spare time for days experimenting,
but to no purpose.</p>

<p>"Even if we did succeed, Less," Ross comforted
himself one day as he looked gloomily at their
latest failure, "we couldn&#8217;t escape from here. We
have no idea where we are, whether we are nearer
Red Lodge or Cody or Timbuctoo. We would
merely start out and leave a half-way comfortable
certainty for a mighty ticklish uncertainty."</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s right," agreed Leslie, "and we couldn&#8217;t
pack enough food on our backs to last many days,
nor can we tell when a storm is coming."</p>

<p>In fact, storms were the order of the day. By
the middle of February immense masses of snow
curled out over the cliffs on the side of the mountain
opposite the shack waiting for the warm
chinooks of spring to send them hurtling down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span>
into the cañon. Fortunately, the mountain above
the shack was lower than its neighbors, and the
face, heavily wooded, sloped back more gently until
it reached a great elevation.</p>

<p>"The trees here prove that there have been no
snowslides within the memory of this generation,
at any rate," Ross broke out one day as they were
sawing the branches from a spruce on the mountainside
above the shack. "Now, if the shack
were on the other side<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"But it wouldn&#8217;t be built on the other side,"
interrupted Leslie. "No cabin builder would do
such a thing unless he built when he first struck
this country as young and green as we were!"</p>

<p>Ross laughed and started the branch he had
trimmed down the mountainside on the crust. It
skidded along rapidly until it wedged itself into a
great snow bank which had drifted from the shack
to the trees on either side, and through which the
boys had tunneled. With the last branch sent
home in this convenient fashion, Ross shouldered
the axe and picked up the saw, while Leslie took
the gun from a near-by branch where it had been
slung, and followed down the mountainside.</p>

<p>With the increase in the depth of the snow, the
coyotes and gray wolves had grown bolder, and
without the gun the boys never went now outside
of their dooryard, as they called the spaces they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span>
had cleared around the shack. So far, however,
the coyotes had only skulked near the strongly
built lean-to, attracted by the smell of the meat,
while the wolves contented themselves by howling
at night from the rocks far above the cabin, and
being answered from the mountainside opposite.</p>

<p>"I have always heard that the gray wolf is a
coward," commented Leslie as the two entered the
shack. "We have not had a glimpse of one yet."</p>

<p>"Uncle Jake said they are far more afraid of
people than sensible people are afraid of them," returned
Ross, "but I&#8217;d rather not be called sensible
than to meet one face to face!"</p>

<p>That night the boys turned in early, tired with
their exertions at the wood-pile. About midnight
they were both awakened by a mysterious noise.
Leslie, in the wall bunk, came up on his elbow
before he was fairly awake. Ross, on the floor,
sat up instantly, whispering sharply:</p>

<p>"Leslie, is that you?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Leslie bewildered. "Is it you?
What was that?"</p>

<p>Before Ross could reply again, the noise was repeated.
It came from above their heads, a soft
padding and crunching on the roof logs. Suddenly
there was added a whining sound and a
scratching at the side and then an increase in the
crunching on the roof.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>"Wolves!" cried Ross and Leslie simultaneously.</p>

<p>"They smell the meat in the lean-to," added
Leslie.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, Less," said Ross, "I&#8217;m glad
we&#8217;re inside a stockade. I&#8217;ll put my trust in
logs rather than boards with those fellows
around."</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s voice was decidedly husky, Leslie was
glad to note. His own was almost beyond control
while cold chills ran up and down his spine.
He grunted assent and tried to yawn aloud but
was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Then, as the soft padding and eager sniffing
continued, he found his voice in a frightened
quaver, "Ross, can they get into the window, do
you think?"</p>

<p>"Or break into the door?" added Ross equally
uncertain as to tone. "One thing I know, Less,
they&#8217;re afraid of fire."</p>

<p>At that both boys came out of their bunks and
began to fill the stove with wood. But at these
sounds from below, the wolves departed hastily
and put in the remainder of the night howling
from the side of the mountain a safe distance
away.</p>

<p>"Guess Uncle Jake is right. They seem as
afraid of us as we are of them!" exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span>
Leslie, lighting a candle and setting it in the
window. Then he turned on Ross with a sheepish
grin. "Say, Doc, is my hair standing straight up?"</p>

<p>Ross passed his hand over his own. "I don&#8217;t
see it stand, but if it feels like mine it won&#8217;t lie
down again in a week. To-morrow, Less, we&#8217;ll
let studies go by the board and have that window
and the door barricaded. Then, if a wolf or two
chance to stumble against them we can turn over
and laugh in our sleep."</p>

<p>There was no more sleep in the shack that
night, however, and before daylight the boys were
up planning the proposed barricade. They finally
hit on two cross poles for the door, fitted into
crudely carved stanchions nailed to either side.
These bars were removed by day, but when night
came, it was with a feeling of relief that the boys
dropped the bars into their stanchions and knew
the device could foil any wolf that prowled about
the mountains. The window, also, was similarly
barricaded.</p>

<p>But, secure behind these protections, the boys
soon became accustomed to their midnight visitors,
and even began to look eagerly for them during
the day, Leslie being a fair shot.</p>

<p>"I would like to get a skin or two, Ross," he
said one evening. "Sue would like &#8217;em as rugs,
you bet!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>It was after supper, and the boys, having washed
the dishes, had blown out the candle and were sitting
beside the stove. The draft in front was open,
and the blazing chunks within sent a cheerful
glow dancing past the window and flickering on
the bunk and the side wall beyond. Outside, the
wind soughed among the branches of the seven
spruces, whipping them savagely. It was densely
dark, darker than it would be an hour later when
the moon swung over the tops of the mountain
opposite the shack. There had been no storm for
several days, but severe cold, so that on top of a
strong crust a light snow drifted about continually.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;m satisfied to leave the skin on the brutes if
they&#8217;ll agree to leave mine on me!" laughed Ross
in answer to Leslie. "Guess you&#8217;re a better sport,
Less, than I am."</p>

<p>Leslie shook his head. "Aw, I&#8217;m no sport," he
disclaimed in a pleased tone. "If I ever think I
am I shall remember the first night the wolves
came."</p>

<p>He was rubbing his head reminiscently when,
suddenly, there came an unexpected sound from
the neighborhood of the window. There was a
thump against the outer logs, followed by the
splinter of glass and the inward rush of cold air.
This was immediately succeeded by a hasty scraping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span>
noise in the midst of which Leslie sprang to
his feet shouting:</p>

<p>"Wolves! Quick, Ross, the door!"</p>

<p>While Leslie sprang to the gun hung on pegs
against the logs near the door, Ross fumbled at the
door fastenings and, in a moment, both boys were
out in front in the clearing that they had shoveled
in front of the door and window. The sound was
rapidly retreating down the side of the slope
toward the seven spruces. Eagerly the boys ran
toward the spruces, which, in the darkness, merely
made a darker spot below them. From the midst
of the trees came the scratching sound on the
crust. Throwing the gun to his shoulder Leslie
excitedly fired again and again in the direction of
the rapidly receding sounds.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed when the chambers of
the gun were emptied. "Of course I haven&#8217;t hit
anything, but I have the satisfaction of knowing
I&#8217;ve shot at a wolf, at least!"</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A HUMILIATING DISCOVERY</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Returning</span> to the cabin, the boys excitedly split
up a box and, binding the dry splinters together,
thrust one end into the stove. A moment later,
Ross, brandishing this improvised torch, and followed
by Leslie, bearing the gun in hands none
too steady, ran down to the seven spruces.</p>

<p>This group of trees, full grown and broad
limbed, interlocked their branches at the foot of
the mountain in the path of the high winds which
roared through the cañon as through a funnel between
the high mountains. The trunks formed a
windbreak for the storms that left their load of
snow heaped to the branches on the upper side at
the expense of the lower side where the crust was
swept as clear of loose snow as though by a broom.</p>

<p>Here, in the shadow of these trees, Leslie, despite
his earnest protest to the contrary, half expected
to see a wolf dead or wounded, but no wolf
appeared. Lowering the torch, the boys made
their way warily around the trees and the drifts
heaped to leeward. The pile of snow had not
been disturbed, nor did they discover any tracks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span>"Less, I&#8217;m not satisfied," exclaimed Ross finally.
"Something broke that window and something
ran down here. There&#8217;s enough loose snow over
this crust to show traces if<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Here the speaker hastily interposed his body between
a gust of wind and the flaring torch.</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s true," asserted Leslie, "but the snow is
so light that this wind has probably moved every
particle of it since that window was broken, and
this crust is too hard to show a track."</p>

<p>Ross uttered a sudden exclamation and plunged
forward, the torch&#8217;s head flaming against the crust.</p>

<p>"Quick, Less, see here!"</p>

<p>Leslie sprang forward and bent over the torch.
"Blood!" he shouted. "I did hit him for sure!
There is a&#8211;no, see here, Ross, here are some more
drops, a neat little collection! I must have hit
hard. Oh, we can track him now easily!"</p>

<p>The telltale drops were scattered on the glistening
face of the crust just below the trees. There
was one splash of red and a few inches further
along scattering drops. Sweeping the crust with
the torch the boys cautiously crossed the cañon
taking care to test the crust with the heels of their
shoes as they advanced. But, to their disappointment,
no more blood appeared, and no further
signs of life. Slowly they zigzagged back and
forth, searching and listening, but to no purpose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>"He got away all right," said Leslie in a voice
of deep chagrin. "Guess, after all, I must only
have scratched him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it&#8217;s queer that a scratch would have
produced that much blood and not another drop,"
returned Ross puzzled. "Such a wound would
keep on bleeding for a few moments at least. We
ought to find more traces right around here."</p>

<p>Convinced of the soundness of this reasoning,
Leslie urged another search. Stopping long
enough to make a fresh torch they returned to the
blood spots and with them as a center carefully
enlarged the circle of their search until they had
again covered the surface, inch by inch, for yards
around.</p>

<p>"He must have stopped and licked the wound
clean right here and then streaked it for the
mountains," said Leslie at last.</p>

<p>Ross shook his head obstinately. "I don&#8217;t
believe it. With your shots pattering around him
he&#8217;d likely streak it for the mountains and attend
to his wounds later&#8211;only in that case there would
be more blood."</p>

<p>Discouraged and cold, the searchers returned to
the cabin. Nailing a box cover over the window,
and barring the door again, they went to bed.</p>

<p>The following morning dawned bright and still
in the Cañon of the Seven Spruces as the boys had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span>
named their home. Tired out with the excitement
and exertion of the previous night they overslept,
and not until the sun had appeared above the
eastern peaks were they ready for a further examination
of the neighborhood of the blood spots.
They searched as they had the previous evening
and with no better results, until noon. Then the
unexpected happened!</p>

<p>They had given up the hunt disgustedly and
were returning to the shack for dinner, when
passing to windward of the seven spruces, Leslie
chanced to pause beside the trunk of the outermost
sentinel in the group. Ross, in advance, turned
and, simultaneously, the gaze of both boys fell on
another evidence that Leslie&#8217;s gun had drawn
blood the night before. Half of each tree trunk
was covered with snow and on the white envelope
of the spruce beside which they stood appeared
four red streaks lying parallel and a couple of
inches away around the curve of the trunk a faint
red blotch. The second of the four streaks contained
the deepest stain.</p>

<p>"I say, Ross!" cried Leslie.</p>

<p>"Less, here you are again!" ejaculated Ross.</p>

<p>For an instant they both stared at the tree trunk
motionless. Then Ross, with a sudden narrowing
of his eyes and upward tilt of his square chin,
strode forward, drew off his mitten and extended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352'></a>352</span>
his arm. The marks were shoulder high. Leslie
gave an exclamation as Ross grasped the trunk,
his four fingers covering the four streaks of blood,
his thumb pressed on the fainter blotch. Then
his hand fell to his side.</p>

<p>"A man!" gasped Leslie. His face turned
white. "Ross, did I shoot a man?"</p>

<p>"That would account for things," said Ross
slowly. He looked back. Only a few feet intervened
between the tree and the blood on the
crust. "If you hurt his hand&#8211;and he steadied
himself here at this tree, and then ran on&#8211;perhaps
before he realized that he was hurt&#8211;and then
staunched the flow in his mittens or on his
clothes&#8211;anywhere<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"It was Sandy!" exclaimed Leslie. His voice
was weak, also his knees.</p>

<p>"Or Weston," added Ross and scowled.</p>

<p>"He&#8211;they were looking in the window<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"
began Leslie.</p>

<p>"And slipped and fell against the glass," added
Ross.</p>

<p>Only one more proof was needed to convince
them that Leslie had drawn human blood, and
that proof they found where they had not thought
to look previously&#8211;beneath the window. There,
in the loose snow blown against the side of the
shack, was the blurred impression of a snow-shoe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353'></a>353</span>"I believe," said Ross with conviction that
night as they sat beside the fire with their door
barred and the window securely shuttered, "I
believe, Less, that it was Sandy and perhaps Waymart,
coming to see if Weston had done his duty by
us."</p>

<p>"But where did they come from?" questioned
Leslie. "Where are we? Can they get over to
Meadow Creek and from there here? Or is there
another way of getting here?"</p>

<p>It was months before that persistent question
was answered, months of a dull routine wherein
the boys turned with more and more zeal to their
studies. Nights now, behind their barred door
and shuttered window, they listened, not for wolves,
but for the return of their human caller, but he
did not come again. Day after day they looked
sharply for prints of snow-shoes, but looked in
vain. Gradually as the spring advanced, the
wolves and coyotes retreated until the boys no
longer carried the gun on their wood-cutting excursions.</p>

<p>"I guess Sue will not see a wolf skin this year,"
Leslie complained in March. "Even in that I
have failed."</p>

<p>Ross, standing over the stove frying bacon,
glanced over his shoulder. "Brace up, Less," he
gibed. "There&#8217;s one thing you haven&#8217;t failed in,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span>
nor I either. We&#8217;ve got outside of more anatomy
and physiology and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s so," Leslie interrupted brightening.
"I&#8217;ve found out what I want to do&#8211;after I&#8217;ve made
my peace with father," soberly. "I guess he&#8217;ll
not make any objections to a doctor in the family.
It strikes me," lugubriously, "that he&#8217;ll be
pleased to find out that I want to be anything!"</p>

<p>March gave place to April, finally; but in the
mountains April showers do not have the effect
they are popularly supposed to have elsewhere,
the showers being great downfalls of snow alternating
with thaws which threatened to turn the
entire cañon into a river and brought to their ears
daily the thunder of the snowslides. By the first
of May the tops of the tallest willows began to
appear, but the boys knew that the roots would
not be visible for six weeks yet, so long does winter
linger among the Shoshones. On the mountainside
above timber-line bowlders began to push
aside their dense white covering.</p>

<p>But with the softening of the great body of
snow, the inhabitants of the cañon became more
closely confined than ever. It was well that the
hot sun did away with the necessity for a fire
during the day, because the boys were able to cut
and shovel their way only to the nearest trees.</p>

<p>"Things are getting worse instead of better,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span>
said Leslie gloomily one day when May was two
weeks old.</p>

<p>The boys sat in the doorway in the red glow of
a warm sunset. At their feet, only a few yards
away, the narrow cañon was transformed into a
river choked with ice and snow and mud flowing
sluggishly among the willows. For weeks the
boys had looked in vain for the subsidence of the
water. On the steep slope of the mountain opposite
lay a mass of wet heavy snow waiting for its
turn to come to plunge into the cañon.</p>

<p>Ross, his eyes on this slope, gave a rueful laugh.
"Less, if only we had such a charge of dynamite
now as we set off under Soapweed Ledge we might
have a little fun across there."</p>

<p>"Fun!" echoed Leslie miserably. "Never connect
that piece of foolishness with the word &#8217;fun.&#8217;
If it hadn&#8217;t been for that shot we probably would
have been in Meadow Creek Valley now hard at
work."</p>

<p>Ross gazed gloomily up the river-like cañon.
He wondered whether the trail from Miners&#8217; Camp
to Meadow Creek was clear yet, and whether the
McKenzies had returned to the valley; for in three
weeks Weimer&#8217;s fifth year of work on the claims
would close. He chafed with impatience at the
delay necessitated by that slowly moving stream.
With the cañon clear, the boys had determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>
to start out and follow its windings until they
came to&#8211;Somewhere.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon of that same week Ross sat
studying beneath the window while Leslie was out
trying to force a path to a fine spruce tree that
promised good fire-wood. The sun had long since
hidden his face behind the mountain against which
the cabin rested, but his rays turned the snow on
the peaks opposite to gold. The day had been
warm. The door stood open, and the fire was
almost out. Near the doorway, and only a few feet
from a solid bank of ice, blossomed a profusion of
forget-me-nots and yellow wild asters. The breeze
which rocked their petals was the breeze of
summer that, nevertheless, carried the tang of the
ice and snow over which it passed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ross, deep in his book, heard a sound,
the crunching of the pine cones and boughs with
which the ground was strewn. A moment later a
shadow moved across his book. He sprang to his
feet, the book falling to the floor, and confronted
a man in the doorway.</p>

<p>The man was middle-aged, large, and stoop-shouldered.
His face was burned and bearded
and furrowed, but astonishment was stamped on
every feature and furrow.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he greeted Ross, as one familiar with
his surroundings greets a stranger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>He stepped inside with that air of assurance
which proclaims ownership. His eyes left Ross,
and swept the shack.</p>

<p>"What<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" he began, and suddenly stopped,
his gaze traveling back curiously to the boy.
"What<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" he began again, but got no further.</p>

<p>Ross was the first one to complete a question,
and it was an eager one.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Cody," returned the stranger, reciprocating
with "And you?"</p>

<p>"Meadow Creek."</p>

<p>"Meadow Creek!" in surprise. "Is the trail
open now?"</p>

<p>Ross shook his head. "I don&#8217;t know. I came
last January."</p>

<p>"January!" The stranger stared, and stuffed
his hands into his pockets. "Do ye mean t&#8217; tell
me ye&#8217;ve been here sence January?"</p>

<p>"Ever since then."</p>

<p>Briefly but excitedly Ross told the story of his
coming.</p>

<p>The stranger, listening, leaned back against the
door-post. Successively he removed his cap,
scratched his head, and contracted his bushy
eyebrows. When Ross finished he was grinning
in grim humor.</p>

<p>"Young man," he began slowly, "this here is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358'></a>358</span>
Wood River cañon. Ye&#8217;re only seven miles from
Miners&#8217; Camp. Ye could &#8217;a&#8217; hoofed it down t&#8217;
Gale&#8217;s Ridge in two hours on top of any crust that
would &#8217;a&#8217; held ye up."</p>

<p>Stepping to the door Ross raised a chagrined
voice, "Leslie, ho, Less! Come here!"</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s unexpected and welcome visitor was
Terry Brown, the owner of several adjacent coal
claims. He had gone out of the mountains the
first of December, his preparations for departure
consisting merely in closing the door of his shack.
He had expected to open it in June on the same
furnishings and provisions which he had left.</p>

<p>"I see how it was," Brown began as the three
talked things over that evening. "That &#8217;ere
Weston waits fer a storm a-purpose. Then he
takes ye a pretty chase around and up and among
them little peaks over at the head waters of Meadow
Creek until he gits ye so mixed up that ye don&#8217;t
know east from west. Then he slides ye over the
cliff, and lands ye in here; and you, thinkin&#8217;
ye&#8217;re miles away from ye don&#8217;t know where, with
a heap o&#8217; danger spots between ye and anywheres,
jest naturally sets down here and behaves yerself.
It was the only sensible thing to do," added Brown
approvingly.</p>

<p>"But in the face of the facts it doesn&#8217;t look
sensible now!" Ross burst out.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i7'></a><img src='images/i-359.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span>"No," meditatively, "but without knowin&#8217; any
of the facts, and with no way t&#8217; know &#8217;em, you
acted with sense, plain hoss sense. But that &#8217;ere
Weston, he sure done you dirt, all right."</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s fists doubled involuntarily. Seeing this,
Brown&#8217;s voice changed.</p>

<p>"Better fergit it, son. Chuck the hull matter.
Ye&#8217;ve lost and they&#8217;ve won; and, if what I hear
of the McKenzies is true, it won&#8217;t do ye no good t&#8217;
keep thinkin&#8217; of this. And when ye git down t&#8217;
Camp I wouldn&#8217;t tell the first man I seen about
this, nuther<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Because," Leslie broke in hotly, "they&#8217;d
laugh at us for staying here so near Camp all
winter."</p>

<p>Brown made no reply, but a slow grin expressed
his opinion.</p>

<p>"I say, Less," Ross broke out, "we don&#8217;t look
any bigger to ourselves than we did when we
found out what that blast under the Ledge had
done for us, do we?"</p>

<p>But Leslie did not hear. He sat with his elbows
on his knees scowling down at the floor. "If we&#8217;re
that near Camp," he reasoned, "it was surely one
of the McKenzies that came up to see if we were
here yet that night that I fired. He chose a night,
you remember, when the snow was light and the
crust icy. No tracks left for us to follow."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span>Their visitor asked for no explanation to this.
He was studying Ross&#8217;s face intently as the boy
sat leaning forward, his hands clasped around his
knees.</p>

<p>"I say!" the older man broke out suddenly.
"Ye look almighty like a feller that rode up in
the stage from Meeteetse yisterday&#8211;almighty like
&#8217;im. They was two of &#8217;em. They got out at
Amos Steele&#8217;s."</p>

<p>"Where did they come from?" asked Ross
absently.</p>

<p>"I dunno. Sheepy Luther said they was Easterners."</p>

<p>"Sheepy Luther!" exclaimed Ross. "I know
Sheepy. His wagon set on the hill just back
of the stage camp when I was there with
Weston."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Wall, Sheepy is down on his
luck. He&#8217;s too old t&#8217; chase sheep, and last winter
he lost five hundred or thereabouts; so he got his
walkin&#8217; papers. He come up yisterday. Stopped
at Steele&#8217;s t&#8217; try t&#8217; git a job with the Gale&#8217;s Ridge
Company. Steele may take &#8217;im on to wrangle the
hosses, but he can&#8217;t do more&#8217;n a boy&#8217;s work. He&#8217;s
done fer; only he don&#8217;t know it."</p>

<p>In the pause which followed Brown again
studied Ross. "This feller," he began again
suddenly, "was a bigger man than ye be; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span>
I vum, ye&#8217;re alike even t&#8217; the way ye squint up
yer eyes and mouth, &#8217;n&#8217;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross came to his feet alertly, his interest at last
aroused.</p>

<p>"His name?" he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>Brown shook his head. "Didn&#8217;t hear no names
except the front ones. They called each other
&#8217;Ross&#8217; &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;Fred.&#8217;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Fred and father!" shouted Ross excitedly.
"They came up yesterday, you say,
and stopped at Gale&#8217;s Ridge!"</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363'></a>363</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNEXPECTED VICTORY</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> boy&#8217;s first feeling of joy was immediately
succeeded by a deep chagrin. Probably his father
had come on to complete the legal process for securing
a clear title to the claims, and had brought
Dr. Grant with him, and Ross must confront them
with news of failure rather than victory. He
winced when he thought of the expression of
disappointment which he felt sure would sweep
over his father&#8217;s face, especially when his father
learned that the way to failure had lain in part
through the boy&#8217;s exercise of his medical knowledge.</p>

<p>"There&#8217;s my snow-shoes," he heard Brown saying,
and the words brought him out of his reverie
back to the present at once. "To-morrer ye better
hoof it down t&#8217; Camp and meet up with yer relation."</p>

<p>"That&#8217;s right, Ross," urged Leslie. "I&#8217;ll stay
here until you can bring more shoes back. In that
case," cheerfully, "you see I&#8217;ll get the better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span>
bargain because you&#8217;ll have to take the brunt<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"
he paused abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, the brunt of the ridicule," added Ross
grimly. "We may as well look the thing squarely
in the face. I&#8217;m pretty hot inside, and I shall
probably boil over at sight of the McKenzies, but&#8211;they&#8217;ve made us ridiculous instead of laying
themselves open to prosecution."</p>

<p>"Except Weston," Leslie burst out significantly.
"Wait till I get hold of father!"</p>

<p>According to the plans laid, Ross set out the following
morning on the snow-shoes. Following
Brown&#8217;s directions, to keep to the side of the mountain,
he threaded the windings of the cañon on reluctant
feet, past the cliff whose dark face mocked
him, over the treacherous rotting ice and packed
snow, and finally emerged into the broader portion
of the cañon which contained Miners&#8217; Camp.</p>

<p>The cabins, deserted the previous December, were
inhabited again. The sound of the woodchopper
was in the air; and, as Ross came into Camp, a
dull reverberating boom from the heart of Dundee
told that the Mountain Company&#8217;s mining operations
were resumed.</p>

<p>But so intent was he on the thought of meeting
his father and uncle that these sights and sounds
did not fill him with the joy he had imagined they
would give. He even failed to notice a man standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span>
in the doorway of a shack, scanning Crosby,
on whose steep face the snow still hung in loosening
masses.</p>

<p>Toward the shack came Bill Travers, the stage-driver
between Meeteetse and Miners&#8217; Camp.</p>

<p>"Wall, beat me," cried the man in the doorway,
"if here ain&#8217;t Doc!"</p>

<p>Ross flashed around and faced Sandy McKenzie.</p>

<p>Sandy&#8217;s hands were rammed into his pockets;
but his sun-burned face was smiling an unruffled
welcome, and his voice rang pleasantly.</p>

<p>"How," Sandy inquired, "did ye get over here
from Medder Creek?"</p>

<p>Ross instantly "boiled over" as he had feared he
should, and said the very thing he had not intended
to say. "You know how I got here! You
know where I came from!"</p>

<p>The stage-driver, joined by a second man, came
nearer and paused. Sandy pushed his hands yet
deeper into his pockets, and looked amazingly innocent.</p>

<p>"Me!" he drawled. "What d&#8217;ye mean?"</p>

<p>At the insolent tone Ross&#8217;s blood boiled. It
hummed through his ears, deafening him to the
sound of his own voice. What he said he never
could recall beyond the general knowledge that he
accused Sandy of the theft of the dynamite and of
his own and Leslie&#8217;s abduction across the mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span>And, when he paused to catch his breath and
steady his voice, Sandy was looking him over with
an amused grin which maddened him.</p>

<p>"Now, ain&#8217;t that a likely story?" he inquired.
"Kept ye a prisoner fer six months not five miles
from Camp on a trail that can be follered at any
time in the year! Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Bill Travers grinned faintly. The other man
turned away with the corners of his mouth twitching,
while Sandy went on:</p>

<p>"And as fer Weston, he went to Missoury the
day after we left Medder Creek, and there he is
now fer all I&#8217;ve heard." Again Sandy&#8217;s laugh
rang out as he added: "That story won&#8217;t hold
water. Why didn&#8217;t ye make up a<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Here Waymart appeared in the doorway of the
shack. He scowled at Ross, but his peremptory
words were aimed at Sandy:</p>

<p>"See here! If we&#8217;re goin&#8217; t&#8217; send that bundle
down by Grasshopper we&#8217;ve got t&#8217; make lively
tracks in here, and ye ought t&#8217; know it!"</p>

<p>"Keep yer hair on tight, Mart," laughed Sandy.</p>

<p>He turned, nevertheless, toward the door. As
he did so, he mechanically withdrew his hands
from his pockets and Ross saw something which
at once arrested his attention. The middle finger
of Sandy&#8217;s right hand was gone! In a flash, memory
showed Ross the four blood streaks on the
trunk of the spruce with the second streak the
deepest in color.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i8'></a><img src='images/i-366.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
YOU&#8217;VE PAID FOR IT.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367'></a>367</span>With his anger still burning he snatched off his
glove and held up his right hand triumphantly,
the middle finger projecting. "Well, anyway,"
he cried, "Leslie ain&#8217;t a bad shot. We may never
prove that you put us in that hole, but you&#8217;ve
paid for it, nevertheless!"</p>

<p>Sandy involuntarily doubled his right hand into
a fist. He caught his under lip between his teeth
and sent Ross a black look as, wordlessly, he entered
the shack and slammed the door behind him,
leaving Ross to tell the story of Leslie&#8217;s shot to two
interested and excited men.</p>

<p>"That accounts fer it," confirmed Bill Travers.
"Sandy and Waymart they come up from Cody
along in February and when they clumb int&#8217; th&#8217;
stage goin&#8217; back, Sandy&#8217;s hand was tied up. Next
thing I knowed when they come up with me
t&#8217; other day, that finger was off clean to the hand,
but Sandy hain&#8217;t never spoken of it."</p>

<p>Ross, leaving Bill to talk the matter over with
his companions, went on rapidly now down the
cañon, his eyes narrowed and his chin protruding
doggedly. One disagreeable scene was ended, and
he was, perhaps, facing another.</p>

<p>"I ought to be sorry that Sandy lost a finger
but&#8211;hanged if I am!" he burst out loud. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span>
was anxious to have Leslie know the result of his
random shot.</p>

<p>Rounding a shoulder of Gale&#8217;s Ridge, he came
in sight of Steele&#8217;s shack. Steele sat in the doorway.
Beside him, leaning against the logs of the
shack&#8217;s side, was a man in shirt-sleeves and cap,
beneath which a rim of woolly gray hair projected.</p>

<p>Facing Steele were two well dressed men, one in
a tall silk hat, which appeared incongruous against
its background of log shack and pine tree.
Ross, with narrowed eyes and compressed lips,
plodded on.</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ve done my best," he muttered defensively.
"It&#8217;s all a fellow can do; but, when that best is
failure, why, it&#8217;s not much consolation."</p>

<p>Then he raised his head, squared his shoulders,
and doggedly faced the four in front of Steele&#8217;s
cabin.</p>

<p>Ross Grant, Senior, had not come West to look
after his claims, but after his son, with whom he
felt he had but just begun an acquaintance. He
had no difficulty in getting Dr. Grant to accompany
him, reënforced as he was by an anxious
Aunt Anne. It was true that both Ross and Steele
had written that all communications with the
former would be shut off for months. But, when
the hot days of June came and brought no letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369'></a>369</span>
from the boy, as Aunt Anne said, "something must
be done."</p>

<p>That something was represented in the persons
of the Grant brothers in Miners&#8217; Camp.</p>

<p>After the first greetings, tinged with amazement
on the part of the four, Ross backed up against a
spruce, and, facing the others, proceeded to answer
the questions with which they bombarded him.</p>

<p>In half an hour they were in possession of the
main facts in his life during the last six months.</p>

<p>"The McKenzies all through," commented
Steele finally; "but&#8211;prove it!"</p>

<p>"I&#8217;ve got to prove it!" declared Ross violently;
"I shall!"</p>

<p>"Ross,"&#8211;Dr. Grant&#8217;s comment carried with it
the pride and honor of his profession,&#8211;"if you&#8217;re
called upon to attend the sick, you must go.
That&#8217;s the duty of a physician, even before he receives
his diploma. You did right."</p>

<p>"I felt that way myself, uncle," returned Ross
quietly. "As soon as Weimer opened the way, I
never thought of not going, so long as there was no
regular doctor within reach."</p>

<p>Ross Grant, Senior, looked his son over. There
was no expression of disapproval on his face as he
took the measure of this full-blooded, broad-shouldered,
erect young man whose muscles had been
hardened by wind and sun and work in the open.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370'></a>370</span>Having completed his survey, Ross, Senior,
smiled. "Well, my boy," he remarked characteristically,
"it took three good sized men to down
you two boys, didn&#8217;t it? And it must have cost
them a heap of thinking into the bargain. Shake,
Ross; I&#8217;m proud of you!"</p>

<p>And Ross, bewildered, shook hands with his
father, his cheeks reddening with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I&#8211;I never thought of it in that way before,"
he stammered. "But&#8211;that doesn&#8217;t save the
claims, and the fifth year is up next week, and
Uncle Jake<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>"Don&#8217;t you worry about Uncle Jake," interrupted
his father meaningly. "We may lose the
claims, but Uncle Jake will be provided for."</p>

<p>"The first thing to do," interpolated Steele, "is
to root him out of Meadow Creek Valley. I&#8217;ve
never known the snow to hang so late to the side
of Crosby."</p>

<p>That very night it ceased to "hang." At midnight
every one in the shack was awakened.
There was a cracking of trees, a long steady rush,
and then a mighty and prolonged roar as the
snow, under the influence of a swift warm wind,
swept down the side of old Crosby, and took the
thousand-feet plunge into the ravine at the foot of
the falls. The roar echoed against the sides of
Dundee and Spar and Sniffle, starting other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span>
though lesser slides until the cañon was filled with
the confusion of sound.</p>

<p>The following morning, Steele, after investigation,
found the trail around the shoulder of
Crosby swept clean, and at once proposed that
they follow it to Meadow Creek. Ross objected
to starting until Leslie reached them. Steele had
sent Society Bill up the cañon the previous evening
with snow-shoes for the boy. But neither
Society Bill nor Leslie had appeared. Ross&#8217;s objections
were, therefore, overruled by the older
men.</p>

<p>"Leave word in the upper camp for him to
follow us when he comes," Steele suggested, "and
we&#8217;ll start right away. We shall have to foot it,
too, for no horse can make it yet."</p>

<p>The sheep-herder, who had shared Steele&#8217;s hospitality
over night, shouldered his blankets, observing
that he was going over with them to see his
friend Weimer, and find out what was "doin&#8217; on
the Creek."</p>

<p>There were others of the same mind also, as the
party from Steele&#8217;s shack found when they reached
the foot of Crosby. Just ahead of them, so engrossed
in their climbing that they did not look
back, were Sandy and Waymart.</p>

<p>Slowly, to accommodate the older Grants, the
party moved up the trail, slippery with mud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span>
and snow, their way obstructed by rocks and
tree trunks.</p>

<p>Sandy and Waymart, ahead, were obliged to
move slowly also; for to their lot fell the removal
of any obstacles too large to surmount,
and the snow and landslide of the previous night
had left many such. Around the shoulder, however,
the trail was intact, the mountain being so
steep at this point that the slide had leaped clear
of the trail and projected itself headlong into the
gorge below.</p>

<p>An hour later Ross called back to his father
and uncle, who were puffing along, breathless
and tired and dizzy: "We&#8217;ll be in sight of the
dump in ten minutes. It&#8217;s just around the spur
of the mountain there."</p>

<p>Then, unable to restrain his impatience and
anxiety longer, he ran on ahead of Steele, keeping
a short distance between himself and the
McKenzies. The McKenzies, however, seemed
no more anxious to enjoy his society than he
did to enjoy theirs. Sandy, for once, omitted
his usual pleasantries, an omission easy to account
for whenever Ross thought of the missing
middle finger of his right hand.</p>

<p>Hearing footsteps behind him, Ross glanced
around. Steele had left the others, and was
following on a run. The McKenzies pushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373'></a>373</span>
on without looking back, and neither Steele nor
Ross spoke.</p>

<p>In silence, then, the four approached the spur.
But before they reached the dump that silence
was most unexpectedly broken. Out of the open
mouth of the tunnel rolled a volume of sound,
then another and another.</p>

<p>Ross in his surprise, his head thrown back as he
scanned the dump, nearly fell over a mass of newly
mined ore which blocked the main trail.</p>

<p>Then he caught a glimpse of Weimer shielding
his eyes from the sun with both hands, waiting for
the effects of the explosions in the tunnel to subside.
And, leaning against the tool house, his
hands in his pockets, his head bent forward, was
another man, the sight of whom caused a great
illumination in Ross&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>"Weston!" he shouted. "Weston!"</p>

<p>The two men on the dump came to the edge,
and looked over. The McKenzies on the trail
ahead halted. The Grants with the sheep-herder
drew nearer.</p>

<p>Weimer, squinting, recognized Ross. He took
off his cap, and waved it as wildly as a boy.</p>

<p>"The vork," he yelled, "ist done! It ist done
dese two veeks. Me und Miller here, ve ist vorkin&#8217;
now joost for de fun!"</p>

<p>Weston gave one glance at Sandy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span>
Waymart, and without speaking went back to the
tunnel.</p>

<p>Ross was after him with a bound, scrambling up
over the dump, followed by the others, who were
infected by his excitement. He ran to Weston
with both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Weston," he shouted, "you did this!"</p>

<p>"Veston!" exclaimed Uncle Jake. "Dot ist
Miller. He has been mit me all der spring."</p>

<p>"I told him," muttered Weston, extending his
hand to Ross, but turning away shamefacedly,
"that you two boys had taken my place with my
sick pard, while I was to stay by him."</p>

<p>Ross pumped the big hand up and down.</p>

<p>"Father," he cried excitedly, "he has saved our
claims."</p>

<p>Weston tried to liberate his hand. He stole a
glance at Sandy and Waymart, who had stopped
just beyond the dump.</p>

<p>"Doc here"&#8211;he spoke to the group who surrounded
him&#8211;"saved me first. I had that little
business to pay for, but"&#8211;his tone sank to a
mutter&#8211;"I thought I could pay it and git away
to Missoury before Sandy found out what I was
up to here<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Sandy&#8217;s voice from the
trail, and the voice was harsh and vengeful.
"Better come over to our shack, Lon. I want a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span>
little talk with ye about old man Quinn. He&#8217;s
wantin&#8217; t&#8217; see ye powerful bad."</p>

<p>At the name the sheep-herder, who had been
standing stupidly staring at Weston, woke up.</p>

<p>"Old man Quinn," he began. "A feller in Cody
told me<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" but no one was paying any attention
to him.</p>

<p>Sandy and Waymart moved on slowly toward
their cabin, talking and gesticulating excitedly,
evidently in disagreement.</p>

<p>For the present no one undeceived Weimer in
regard to Miller.</p>

<p>"He come pack in all dot storm," Weimer exulted,
"und mit me vas."</p>

<p>Weston looked away, but Steele cried, "Good
work, man," clapping him warmly on the shoulder.
Then he added boyishly: "I&#8217;m hungry as a bear!
Got any grub left?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Weston quietly, "plenty.
Come on down all of you, and I&#8217;ll rustle some
flapjacks and coffee."</p>

<p>They started down the trail, Weston and Ross
in advance. At the mention of "old man Quinn"
Ross&#8217;s elation had subsided. He looked at Weston
out of the corner of his eye. The other&#8217;s eyes
were downcast and his face pale beneath its sunburn.
His hair was of a peculiar color, light at
the roots and dark at the ends. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376'></a>376</span>
evidently forgotten to bring his hair dye to Meadow
Creek.</p>

<p>The older man spoke first. His voice was low
and his words halting. "I had to take you across
the mountain and leave you there," he explained
briefly. "Sandy was behind the cabin when we
got there. I couldn&#8217;t fool &#8217;im about you, but I
did about myself; and, if you all had put off
comin&#8217; over a day longer, I could have got away
out of Sandy&#8217;s reach."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Weston&#8217;s hand involuntarily crept
up to his breast pocket. It fell again, however, as
he added in a mutter as though to himself: "And
Less&#8211;I had to take &#8217;im over too&#8211;for my own good.
But it&#8217;s all up now and I&#8217;ve got to face it out."</p>

<p>Just behind them came the sheep-herder, his
thoughts reverting to a subject on which he had
tried once to speak. Now he saw an opportunity.</p>

<p>"Ye must &#8217;a&#8217; known of old man Quinn then,"
he called to Weston. "Didn&#8217;t ye?"</p>

<p>Weston stumbled. He caught himself, but the
movement saved him from the necessity of an
answer.</p>

<p>"Wall," the sheep-herder went on, almost running
in order to keep up with the pace Weston
had set, "I met Happy in Cody t&#8217; other day,
and Happy said old man Quinn had pinched the
fourth puncher that druv his sheep<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span>"What?" shouted Weston. He swung around
so suddenly that the sheep-herder ran full tilt
against him.</p>

<p>"What?" Weston shouted again. He seized
the amazed and terrified Sheepy, and held him by
the arms in a vise that made the man wince.
"Say that again."</p>

<p>"S-say what?" faltered Sheepy.</p>

<p>"What about the fourth? Tell me!"</p>

<p>With every word Weston, his eyes ablaze, his
lips drawn back over strong white teeth, gave the
old sheep-herder a convulsive shake.</p>

<p>"W-why," the old man quavered, "Happy,
he said that a feller down in Oklahomy, name of
Burns, went and give himself up to old man
Quinn. He said he was the feller the old man
was after&#8211;that he was the fourth who done the
business with the sheep. But because he owned
up the jedge give &#8217;im only six months<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Weston suddenly pushed the sheep-herder from
him, his face working convulsively. "Then I
wasn&#8217;t in it!" he cried. "Sandy said I was, but
I wasn&#8217;t!"</p>

<p>Offering no further explanation to his astonished
hearers, he turned toward the McKenzie shack on
a run; and for a couple of hours they saw no more
of him.</p>

<p>It was a busy time for Ross, who promptly took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span>
Weston&#8217;s place "rustling grub." But, as he
worked, his thoughts wonderingly circled around
Weston&#8217;s strange actions. The fourth man was
found and it was not Weston&#8211;yet Weston, it would
appear, had believed himself to be the guilty
party! It was too deep a puzzle for Ross. As
the boy worked he kept a watchful eye on the
trail for Leslie. Surely the latter would come
down to Camp that morning and receive the word
Ross had left him at the post-office.</p>

<p>Steele, who had stayed behind long enough to
examine the tunnel, confirmed Weimer&#8217;s statement
that more than enough work had been done to
cover the requirements of the law. Weimer, jubilant,
sat and talked to his old-time "pard," whose
voice answered him, but whose satisfied gaze
followed Ross.</p>

<p>But it was to the man who had stood in the
place of a father to him that Ross&#8217;s eyes turned
most frequently. Dr. Grant sat, appropriately,
on the emergency chest, looking affectionately at
his energetic nephew.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ross picked up a tin cup full of water
from the table, and held it out at arm&#8217;s length
toward his uncle.</p>

<p>Dr. Grant smiled. "All right, Ross," he said
quietly.</p>

<p>Ross, Senior, looked from one to the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379'></a>379</span>
inquiringly. Ross, Junior, answered; but he turned
his back on his father, and spoke hesitatingly.
"I was showing uncle, father, that my hand is
still steady enough to be the hand of a first
class&#8211;surgeon."</p>

<p>Promptly and heartily came the unexpected
response from the elder Grant. "I&#8217;m glad of that,
Ross, for I shall look to see you as successful in
your profession as you have been in my business,"
and he turned at once to Weimer, and went on
speaking.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he was saying, "as long as you want
to stay here, you get your friend"&#8211;he indicated
the sheep-herder&#8211;"to come and live with you.
I&#8217;m going to buy out Ross&#8217;s interest in the shares,
and I&#8217;ll look to you to keep &#8217;em in good shape&#8211;you
and your friend&#8211;until we get a chance to sell
well. Of course," he added carelessly, "I&#8217;ll grub-stake
you and more, both of you."</p>

<p>Sheepy&#8217;s eyes lighted, and Weimer grinned and
slapped his knee. They were the only signs
necessary to complete the bargain.</p>

<p>After dinner, as Ross arose from the table, he
saw Leslie hurrying down the trail. Ross went to
meet him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ross!" Leslie called in a voice which
he tried to make matter-of-fact, but which bubbled
over with jubilation. "I stopped in at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380'></a>380</span>
post-office and got your word and a letter from dad.
It&#8217;s only a month old! He thinks we&#8217;re mewed
up over here, you know, working your claims.
And he says he and Sue want me to come home
as soon as I get this letter. He says if I&#8217;m willing
to work he&#8217;ll give me better wages than I can get
anywhere else! He doesn&#8217;t know yet," here Leslie
grinned broadly, "that I want to do now the very
thing he has fought all my life to make me do&#8211;go
to school. That doctor business has sort of
sunk in. But say, Ross, here&#8217;s a thing that
bothers me." Leslie pulled the letter from his
pocket and read:</p>

<p>"&#8217;A few days ago I got hold of the fourth man
that ran my sheep off into the river two years ago.
The fellow came and gave himself up to me.&#8217;"</p>

<p>The reader looked up tentatively. "Ross, if it
was Weston dad would have said<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>"</p>

<p>Ross&#8217;s hand descended on the other&#8217;s shoulder
in a mighty whack as he shouted: "It isn&#8217;t Weston.
Now you listen and give me an inning on
the talk!"</p>

<p>For half an hour they stood outside the shack
while Ross got his inning&#8211;Sandy&#8217;s hand, the
work, Weston&#8217;s strange actions were all reviewed
hurriedly and listened to excitedly. Then, seeing
Weston approaching, the boys went inside.</p>

<p>Weston crossed the valley slowly, looking down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381'></a>381</span>
at something which he held in the palm of his
hand, something in a small gilt frame that he
slipped into his breast pocket when he entered the
shack.</p>

<p>Completely absorbed in his own thoughts&#8211;cheerful
thoughts too, apparently&#8211;he went directly
to his bunk, and began gathering his few possessions
together not noticing that the group had been
augmented by Leslie.</p>

<p>"I guess," he explained abstractedly, "that I&#8217;ll
go on at once&#8211;I&#8217;m going to Oklahoma and not
Missouri." Then he looked over his shoulder at
the sheep-herder, adding abstractedly: "Waymart
says I ain&#8217;t the fourth, and never was. He&#8217;s
been makin&#8217; up his mind to tell me this good
while."</p>

<p>The blank expression on the sheep-herder&#8217;s face
brought Weston back to a sense of his surroundings.</p>

<p>"I forgot," he muttered turning to Ross, who
stood beside the bunk, "that you may not know
about this Quinn business."</p>

<p>Leslie stepped forward quickly, but paused as he
saw Weston was oblivious of his presence.</p>

<p>"I know a good deal about it," exclaimed Ross
impulsively, "and I wish I knew the rest&#8211;your
part of it."</p>

<p>Weston leaned against the bunk, his back toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382'></a>382</span>
the silent room, his eyes downcast. He made the
explanation with visible reluctance.</p>

<p>"You see, Doc, I used to drink; and when I
had two or three glasses down, I&#8217;d go out of my
head; and when I had come to myself again I
wouldn&#8217;t know a blooming thing that had happened
while I was drunk. But all the time I could
ride straight and talk straight and shoot straight."</p>

<p>He paused to moisten his lips. Leslie came a
step nearer.</p>

<p>"Well," Weston continued, "to make a long
story short, I was foreman on a cattle ranch in
Oklahoma two years ago. Sandy and Mart came
around wanting a job, and I gave &#8217;em one on the
same ranch. Then came the big round-up at
North Fork&#8211;and there was trouble between the
sheep and cattle men."</p>

<p>Weston hesitated and looked down. He raised
his hand to his breast pocket and let it fall at his
side.</p>

<p>"The night the round-up ended most of us&#8211;got drunk."</p>

<p>He paused, shook himself impatiently, and hurried
on: "I didn&#8217;t go with the rest intending to
drink&#8211;but I did, what with treating and all that.
And when I come to myself, Sandy told me I was
one of the men who had done the job on the Quinn
sheep. And, knowing what I am when drunk, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383'></a>383</span>
believed him and cleared out with him and Mart
over the Texas line, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>" his hand traveled
to his hair completing the sentence.</p>

<p>"I see!" exclaimed Ross excitedly; "and since
then Sandy has held that over you."</p>

<p>Weston nodded. "I was sick of drink, but I
got sick of it too late, you see. I&#8217;d put a lasso
round my own neck just when I most wanted to
be free."</p>

<p>His hand again wandered toward his breast
pocket.</p>

<p>"But now," he added, "I am free."</p>

<p>He lifted his head proudly and turning, was
aware for the first time of Leslie&#8217;s presence. As
the hands of the two met Ross strode across the
room and began speaking loudly and at random to
the others, leaving Sue&#8217;s lover and Sue&#8217;s brother to
talk alone.</p>

<p>Presently, however, unable to restrain the question
longer, Ross turned again on Weston.</p>

<p>"Sandy stole our sticks, didn&#8217;t he?" he demanded,
"and planned the whole thing to get rid
of me?"</p>

<p>Weston turned slowly back to his bunk. For a
moment he fumbled among the blankets in silence.
Then he faced about again resolutely.</p>

<p>"Say, Doc, you have your claims here secure,
haven&#8217;t you, and Sandy has lost &#8217;em?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384'></a>384</span>"Yes, thanks to you."</p>

<p>"And you&#8217;ve got outside of enough of those
books so you can go to college next year, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, again thanks to you!"</p>

<p>"And," here Weston glanced at Leslie, "Sandy
has dropped a finger somewhere in the game."</p>

<p>Leslie could not restrain a look of exultation.
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let this thing drop, will you?
Sandy hain&#8217;t all to the bad. He&#8217;s pulled me out
of as many holes as he&#8217;s chucked me into; and I&#8211;well,
I&#8211;say, Doc, call it square, will you?"</p>

<p>Ross glanced from his father to his uncle and
then at Steele. A glance satisfied him. Stepping
forward, he extended his hand.</p>

<p>"It&#8217;s square, Weston, and I&#8217;ll let everything go
except&#8211;I can&#8217;t forget that you&#8217;ve pulled me out
of a pretty big hole&#8211;the worst one I ever dropped
into."</p>
